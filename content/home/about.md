# Biography

I am currently a research scientist at the University of Washington hosted by Prof. Ras Bodik. I will be joining the computer science department at UCSB as an assistant professor in Fall 2019. 
Previously, I received my Ph.D. in computer science from UT Austin and my advisor is Prof. Isil Dillig, and I started my 
research as a visiting student at Stanford University under the supervision of Dr. Saswat Anand and Prof. Alex Aiken in 2013.

My research interests include programming languages, program analysis and verification, program synthesis, and security. More specifically, I want to build automated tools to guarantee the desired behavior of a system in a sound, precise and scalable way. I am also interested in applying program synthesis/analysis to build and break systems, tackling security and performance problems in mobile devices and blockchain.

 I am looking for self-motivated and talented students at UCSB. If you are interested in building cutting-edge program synthesis/analysis framework that combines the power of logical reasoning and machine learning, please drop me an email with your CV.
