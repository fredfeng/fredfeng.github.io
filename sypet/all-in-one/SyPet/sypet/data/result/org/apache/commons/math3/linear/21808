The returned value is not required to be \u003cem\u003eexact\u003c/em\u003e. Instead, the norm of the so-called \u003cem\u003eupdated\u003c/em\u003e residual (if available) should be returned. For example, the {@link ConjugateGradient conjugate gradient} method computes a sequenceof residuals, the norm of which is cheap to compute. However, due to accumulation of round-off errors, this residual might differ from the true residual after some iterations. See e.g. A. Greenbaum and Z.
