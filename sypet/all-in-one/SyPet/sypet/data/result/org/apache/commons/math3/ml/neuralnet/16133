Update will be performed only if the expected values match the current values.\u003cbr/\u003e In effect, when concurrent threads call this method, the state could be modified by one, so that it does not correspond to the the state assumed by another. Typically, a caller  {@link #getFeatures() retrieves the current state}, and uses it to compute the new state. During this computation, another thread might have done the same thing, and updated the state: If the current thread were to proceed with its own update, it would overwrite the new state (which might already have been used by yet other threads). To prevent this, the method does not perform the update when a concurrent modification has been detected, and returns  {@code false}. When this happens, the caller should fetch the new current state, redo its computation, and call this method again.\n * @param expect Current values of the features, as assumed by the caller.Update will never succeed if the contents of this array does not match the values returned by  {@link #getFeatures()}.\n * @param update Features\u0027s new values.\n * @return {@code true} if the update was successful, {@code false}otherwise.\n * @throws DimensionMismatchException if the length of {@code update} isnot the same as specified in the  {@link #Neuron(long,double[]) constructor}.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":2,"atom":1,"perform":2,"specifi":1,"expect":2,"thread":4,"proceed":1,"happen":1,"fetch":1,"except":1,"succeed":1,"done":1,"prevent":1,"content":1,"updat":9,"redo":1,"will":2,"comput":3,"match":2,"compar":1,"thing":1,"array":1,"otherwis":1,"caller":3,"call":2,"might":2,"overwrit":1,"correspond":1,"concurr":2,"one":1,"link":3,"typic":1,"state":7,"use":2,"anoth":2,"isnot":1,"length":1,"current":5,"valu":5,"constructor":1,"detect":1,"assum":2,"true":1,"dimens":1,"neuron":2,"never":1,"effect":1,"retriev":1,"modifi":1,"featur":6,"method":3,"alreadi":1,"mismatch":1,"success":1,"modif":1,"yet":1},"maxFreq":9,"totalTerms":106},"loc":21}
