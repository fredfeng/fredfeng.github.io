It is mathematically defined as the angle of the rotation r that prepended to one of the rotations gives the other one:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e r\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e(r) \u003d r\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e \u003c/pre\u003e \u003cp\u003eThis distance is an angle between 0 and \u0026pi;. Its value is the smallest possible upper bound of the angle in radians between r\u003csub\u003e1\u003c/sub\u003e(v) and r\u003csub\u003e2\u003c/sub\u003e(v) for all possible vectors v. This upper bound is reached for some v.

It is much more stable, and has a geometric meaning. Also comparing quaternions components is error prone since for example quaternions (0.36, 0.48, -0.48, -0.64) and (-0.36, -0.48, 0.48, 0.64) represent exactly the same rotation despite their components are different (they are exact opposites).\u003c/p\u003e\n * @param r1 first rotation\n * @param r2 second rotation\n * @param \u003c T \u003e the type of the field elements\n * @return \u003ci\u003edistance\u003c/i\u003e between r1 and r2\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"second":1,"possibl":2,"type":1,"almost":1,"exact":2,"element":1,"alway":1,"done":1,"rotat":9,"quaternion":3,"much":1,"prone":1,"distanc":6,"comput":1,"angl":3,"compar":3,"defin":1,"sub":8,"give":1,"one":2,"way":2,"use":1,"opposit":1,"upper":2,"transform":1,"reach":1,"stabl":1,"ident":1,"vector":2,"rather":1,"mean":1,"valu":2,"geometr":1,"similar":1,"check":1,"error":1,"repres":1,"prepend":1,"mathemat":1,"smallest":1,"equal":1,"despit":1,"radian":1,"field":1,"two":4,"differ":2,"compon":3,"pre":2,"exampl":2,"intend":1,"first":1,"also":1,"bound":2},"maxFreq":9,"totalTerms":95},"loc":3}
