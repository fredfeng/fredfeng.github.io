Let f(x) \u003d ln(x), We know that f\u0027(x) \u003d 1/x, thus from Taylor\u0027s theorem we have: -----          n+1         n f(x) \u003d   \\           (-1)    (x - 1) /          ----------------    for 1 \u003c\u003d n \u003c\u003d infinity -----             n or 2        3       4 (x-1)   (x-1)    (x-1) ln(x) \u003d  (x-1) - ----- + ------ - ------ + ... 2       3        4 alternatively, 2    3   4 x    x   x ln(x+1) \u003d  x - -  + - - - + ... 2    3   4 This series can be used to compute ln(x), but it converges too slowly.

Because the even powered ones absorbed the sign.  Now, subtract the series above from the previous one to get ln(x+1) - ln(1-x).

This is easily solved to find that x \u003d (a-1)/(a+1).\n * @param a number for which we want the exponential\n * @param one constant with value 1 at desired precision\n * @param two constant with value 2 at desired precision\n * @return ln(a)\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"seri":2,"infin":1,"one":4,"use":1,"taylor":1,"cancel":1,"desir":2,"substitut":1,"altern":1,"slowli":1,"exponenti":1,"precis":2,"easili":1,"power":1,"valu":3,"converg":1,"find":3,"want":2,"note":2,"constant":2,"previous":1,"theorem":1,"thus":1,"number":1,"know":1,"solv":1,"sign":1,"two":1,"subtract":1,"absorb":1,"logarithm":1,"term":2,"now":3,"leav":1,"comput":3,"negat":1,"even":2,"properti":1,"odd":1},"maxFreq":4,"totalTerms":59},"loc":23}
