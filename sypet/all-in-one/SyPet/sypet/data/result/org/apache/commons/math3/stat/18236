The mode is the most frequently occurring value in the sample. If there is a unique value with maximum frequency, this value is returned as the only element of the output array. Otherwise, the returned array contains the maximum frequency elements in increasing order.  For example, if  {@code sample} is {0, 12, 5, 6, 0, 13, 5, 17},the returned array will have length two, with 0 in the first element and 5 in the second. \u003cp\u003eNaN values are ignored when computing the mode - i.e., NaNs will never appear in the output array.
