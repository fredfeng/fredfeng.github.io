Each element of the list represents one segment, and each segment contains a start point at index 0 and an end point at index 1. If the sub-line is unbounded in the negative infinity direction, the start point of the first segment will have infinite coordinates. If the sub-line is unbounded in the positive infinity direction, the end point of the last segment will have infinite coordinates. So a sub-line covering the whole line will contain just one row and both elements of this row will have infinite coordinates.
