A classical approach is to compute only the diagonal elements of the hessian and to divide the raw search direction by these elements if they are all positive. If at least one of them is negative, it is safer to return a clone of the raw search direction as if the hessian was the identity matrix. The rationale for this simplified choice is that a negative diagonal element means the current point is far from the optimum and preconditioning will not be efficient anyway in this case. \u003c/p\u003e\n * @param point current point at which the search direction was computed\n * @param r raw search direction (i.e. opposite of the gradient)\n * @return approximation of H\u003csup\u003e-1\u003c/sup\u003er where H is the objective function hessian\n * @exception FunctionEvaluationException if no cost can be computed for the parameters\n * @exception IllegalArgumentException if point dimension is wrong\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"least":1,"drop":1,"precondit":4,"perform":1,"approxim":1,"must":1,"function":2,"anyway":1,"search":6,"effici":1,"argument":1,"clone":1,"element":3,"except":4,"far":1,"cost":1,"simplifi":1,"will":2,"comput":4,"negat":2,"fast":1,"drastic":1,"posit":1,"raw":3,"optimum":1,"one":1,"hessian":3,"object":1,"diagon":2,"opposit":1,"sup":2,"algorithm":1,"ident":1,"safer":1,"rational":1,"current":2,"mean":1,"classic":1,"direct":6,"matrix":1,"paramet":1,"divid":1,"choic":1,"evalu":1,"dimens":1,"illeg":1,"point":4,"approach":1,"wrong":1,"gradient":1},"maxFreq":6,"totalTerms":84},"loc":0}
