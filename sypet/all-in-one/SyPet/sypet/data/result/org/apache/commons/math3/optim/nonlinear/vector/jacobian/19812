Additional criteria can defined through the setting of a  {@link ConvergenceChecker}.\n * @param initialStepBoundFactor Positive input variable used indetermining the initial step bound. This bound is set to the product of initialStepBoundFactor and the euclidean norm of {@code diag * x} if non-zero, or else to {@code initialStepBoundFactor}itself. In most cases factor should lie in the interval {@code (0.1, 100.0)}.  {@code 100} is a generally recommended value.\n * @param costRelativeTolerance Desired relative error in the sum ofsquares.\n * @param parRelativeTolerance Desired relative error in the approximatesolution parameters.\n * @param orthoTolerance Desired max cosine on the orthogonality betweenthe function vector and the columns of the Jacobian.\n * @param threshold Desired threshold for QR ranking. If the squared normof a column vector is smaller or equal to this threshold during QR decomposition, it is considered to be a zero vector and hence the rank of the matrix is reduced.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"squar":1,"jacobian":1,"variabl":1,"zero":2,"desir":4,"function":1,"rank":2,"diag":1,"norm":1,"ofsquar":1,"relat":4,"levenberg":1,"euclidean":1,"argument":1,"control":1,"henc":1,"cost":1,"procedur":1,"els":1,"non":1,"input":1,"column":2,"approximatesolut":1,"posit":1,"marquardt":1,"defin":1,"behaviour":1,"link":1,"use":1,"sum":1,"cosin":1,"recommend":1,"consid":1,"smaller":1,"normof":1,"par":1,"vector":3,"betweenth":1,"indetermin":1,"valu":1,"initi":4,"converg":2,"toler":3,"ortho":1,"addit":1,"max":1,"optim":1,"check":1,"criteria":1,"error":2,"matrix":1,"orthogon":1,"paramet":1,"equal":1,"factor":4,"checker":1,"general":1,"threshold":3,"product":1,"interv":1,"decomposit":1,"reduc":1,"bound":5,"step":4,"lie":1},"maxFreq":5,"totalTerms":95},"loc":8}
