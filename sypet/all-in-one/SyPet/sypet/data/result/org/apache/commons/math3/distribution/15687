In general, the PDF is the derivative of the {@link #cumulativeProbability(double) CDF}. If the derivative does not exist at  {@code x}, then an appropriate replacement should be returned, e.g.  {@code Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY}, {@code Double.NaN}, or the limit inferior or limit superior of the difference quotient. Note that due to the floating point precision and under/overflow issues, this method will for some distributions be more precise and faster than computing the logarithm of {@link #density(double)}.
