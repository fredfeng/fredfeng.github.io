This method is only called for external entities which have been properly declared. This method provides more flexibility than the  {@link EntityResolver}interface, supporting implementations of more complex catalogue schemes such as the one defined by the \u003ca href\u003d \"http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec-2001-08-06.html\" \u003eOASIS XML Catalogs\u003c/a\u003e specification.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eParsers configured to use this resolver method will call it to determine the input source to use for any external entity being included because of a reference in the XML text. That excludes the document entity, and any external entity returned by  {@link #getExternalSubset getExternalSubset()}. When a (non-validating) processor is configured not to include a class of entities (parameter or general) through use of feature flags, this method is not invoked for such entities.  \u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eNote that the entity naming scheme used here is the same one used in the  {@link LexicalHandler}, or in the  {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#skippedEntity ContentHandler.skippedEntity()}method. \u003c/p\u003e\n * @param name Identifies the external entity being resolved.Either \"[dtd]\" for the external subset, or a name starting with \"%\" to indicate a parameter entity, or else the name of a general entity.  This is never null when invoked by a SAX2 parser.\n * @param publicId The public identifier of the external entity beingreferenced (normalized as required by the XML specification), or null if none was supplied.\n * @param baseURI The URI with respect to which relative systemIDsare interpreted.  This is always an absolute URI, unless it is null (likely because the XMLReader was given an InputSource without one).  This URI is defined by the XML specification to be the one associated with the \"\u0026lt;\" starting the relevant declaration.\n * @param systemId The system identifier of the external entitybeing referenced; either a relative or absolute URI. This is never null when invoked by a SAX2 parser; only declared entities, and any external subset, are resolved by such parsers.\n * @return An InputSource object describing the new input source tobe used by the parser.  Returning null directs the parser to resolve the system ID against the base URI and open a connection to resulting URI.\n * @exception SAXException Any SAX exception, possibly wrappinganother exception.\n * @exception IOException Probably indicating a failure to createa new InputStream or Reader, or an illegal URL.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"referenc":1,"open":2,"entityb":1,"scheme":2,"given":1,"refer":2,"createa":1,"relat":2,"tobe":1,"processor":1,"href":1,"support":1,"catalog":1,"invok":3,"alway":1,"resolv":6,"describ":1,"absolut":2,"like":1,"provid":1,"without":1,"els":1,"non":1,"content":2,"configur":2,"system":4,"http":1,"start":2,"wrappinganoth":1,"will":1,"sax":1,"sourc":5,"xexcept":1,"committe":1,"spec":1,"stream":1,"complex":1,"convent":1,"link":4,"use":7,"org":2,"applic":1,"resolut":1,"document":1,"indic":2,"unless":1,"associ":1,"extern":11,"map":1,"tell":1,"note":1,"direct":1,"failur":1,"idsar":1,"either":2,"base":2,"beingreferenc":1,"method":5,"catalogu":1,"respect":1,"oasi":1,"relev":1,"normal":1,"possibl":1,"skip":2,"lexic":1,"requir":1,"probabl":1,"none":1,"proper":1,"dtd":1,"except":5,"text":1,"xml":1,"flexibl":1,"input":6,"reader":1,"flag":1,"entiti":18,"determin":1,"parser":7,"lreader":1,"result":1,"valid":1,"defin":2,"call":2,"allow":1,"connect":1,"one":4,"www":1,"interpret":1,"identifi":3,"exclud":1,"object":1,"subset":4,"declar":3,"name":4,"includ":2,"paramet":2,"suppli":1,"illeg":1,"general":2,"specif":3,"never":2,"featur":1,"html":1,"handler":3},"maxFreq":18,"totalTerms":212},"loc":0}
