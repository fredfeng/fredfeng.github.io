SAX also reports internal entity expansion/non-expansion, except within markup constructs.) \u003cp\u003eThe Parser will invoke this method each time the entity is skipped.  Non-validating processors may skip entities if they have not seen the declarations (because, for example, the entity was declared in an external DTD subset).  All processors may skip external entities, depending on the values of the \u003ccode\u003ehttp://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities\u003c/code\u003e and the \u003ccode\u003ehttp://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities\u003c/code\u003e properties.\u003c/p\u003e\n * @param name the name of the skipped entity.
