{"id":11902,"className":"org.joda.time.Period","methodName":"Period","signature":"\u003corg.joda.time.Period: void Period(org.joda.time.ReadableInstant,org.joda.time.ReadableInstant)\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Creates a period between the given instants using the standard set of fields. \u003cp\u003e Most calculations performed by this method have obvious results. The special case is where the calculation is from a \"long\" month to a \"short\" month. Here, the result favours increasing the months field rather than the days. For example, 2013-01-31 to 2013-02-28 is treated as one whole month. By contrast, 2013-01-31 to 2013-03-30 is treated as one month and 30 days (exposed as 4 weeks and 2 days). The results are explained by considering that the start date plus the calculated period result in the end date. \u003cp\u003e Another special case is around daylight savings. Consider the case where there is a DST gap from 01:00 to 02:00. The period from 00:30 to 02:30 will return one hour, not two, due to the missing hour. However, once the period exceeds one day, a different effect comes into play. Consider the period from 00:30 just before the DST gap to 02:30 one day later. Since this exceeds a day, the algorithm first adds one day following normal period rules, to get 00:30 one day later, and then adds 2 hours to reach 02:30. In this way, the DST gap effectively \"disappears\". In other words, the addition of days takes precedence over the addition of hours.\n * @param startInstant  interval start, null means now\n * @param endInstant  interval end, null means now\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"save":1,"normal":1,"perform":1,"contrast":1,"obvious":1,"given":1,"howev":1,"instant":3,"follow":1,"plus":1,"creat":1,"calcul":3,"period":7,"now":2,"start":3,"whole":1,"month":5,"will":1,"due":1,"word":1,"day":9,"explain":1,"treat":2,"gap":3,"increas":1,"result":4,"one":7,"way":1,"use":1,"anoth":1,"add":2,"date":2,"consid":3,"algorithm":1,"reach":1,"rule":1,"mean":2,"rather":1,"expos":1,"favour":1,"end":3,"just":1,"addit":2,"standard":1,"later":2,"exceed":2,"play":1,"come":1,"hour":4,"around":1,"interv":2,"field":2,"preced":1,"two":1,"differ":1,"effect":2,"take":1,"exampl":1,"special":2,"method":1,"disappear":1,"first":1,"daylight":1,"miss":1,"week":1},"maxFreq":9,"totalTerms":119},"loc":3}
