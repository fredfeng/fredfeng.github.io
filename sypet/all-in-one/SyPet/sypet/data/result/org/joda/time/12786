This occurs because the new DateMidnight rounds down the millisecond value to get to midnight, and the time zone change may result in a rounding down to a different day. \u003cp\u003e For example, changing time zone from London (+00:00) to Paris (+01:00) will retain the same day, but changing from Paris to London will change the day.
