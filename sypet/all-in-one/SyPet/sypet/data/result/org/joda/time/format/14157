In addition, it is illegal for any but the last of the parser array elements to be null. If the last element is null, this represents the empty parser. The presence of an empty parser indicates that the entire array of parse formats is optional. \u003cp\u003e The printer and parser interfaces are the low-level part of the formatting API.
