The abuts state takes precedence over the other two, thus a zero duration interval at the start of a larger interval abuts and does not overlap. \u003cp\u003e For example: \u003cpre\u003e [09:00 to 10:00) abuts [08:00 to 08:30)  \u003d false (completely before) [09:00 to 10:00) abuts [08:00 to 09:00)  \u003d true [09:00 to 10:00) abuts [08:00 to 09:01)  \u003d false (overlaps) [09:00 to 10:00) abuts [09:00 to 09:00)  \u003d true [09:00 to 10:00) abuts [09:00 to 09:01)  \u003d false (overlaps) [09:00 to 10:00) abuts [10:00 to 10:00)  \u003d true [09:00 to 10:00) abuts [10:00 to 10:30)  \u003d true [09:00 to 10:00) abuts [10:30 to 11:00)  \u003d false (completely after) [14:00 to 14:00) abuts [14:00 to 14:00)  \u003d true [14:00 to 14:00) abuts [14:00 to 15:00)  \u003d true [14:00 to 14:00) abuts [13:00 to 14:00)  \u003d true \u003c/pre\u003e\n * @param interval  the interval to examine, null means now\n * @return true if the interval abuts\n * @since 1.1\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":4,"result":1,"one":1,"state":2,"zero":2,"specifi":1,"durat":2,"inclus":1,"three":1,"mean":1,"immedi":2,"exclus":1,"examin":1,"instant":1,"end":2,"complet":2,"overlap":5,"thus":1,"larger":1,"true":8,"without":1,"interv":12,"two":2,"preced":1,"now":1,"start":3,"pre":2,"abut":19,"take":1,"exampl":1,"compar":1,"gap":1},"maxFreq":19,"totalTerms":85},"loc":9}
