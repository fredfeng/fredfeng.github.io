Unlike wrap, which encapsulates the user message in the returned token, only the message MIC is produced in the output token. This method is equivalent to the byte array based  {@link #getMIC(byte[],int,int,MessageProp) getMIC} method.Note that privacy can only be applied through the wrap call.\u003cp\u003e Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted by getMIC to provide \"secure framing\", implementations should support derivation of MICs from zero-length messages.\n * @param inStream an InputStream containing the message to generate theMIC over. All of the data that is available in inStream is used.\n * @param outStream an OutputStream to write the output token to.\n * @param msgProp an instance of \u003ccode\u003eMessageProp\u003c/code\u003e that is usedby the application to set the desired QOP.
