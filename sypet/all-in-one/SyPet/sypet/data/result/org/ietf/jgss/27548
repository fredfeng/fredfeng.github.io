This method allows the construction of credentials, one mechanism at a time.\u003cp\u003e This routine is envisioned to be used mainly by context acceptors during the creation of acceptor credentials which are to be used with a variety of clients using different security mechanisms.\u003cp\u003e This routine adds the new credential element \"in-place\".  To add the element in a new credential, first call \u003ccode\u003eclone\u003c/code\u003e to obtain a copy of this credential, then call its \u003ccode\u003eadd\u003c/code\u003e method.\u003cp\u003e As always, GSS-API implementations must impose a local access-control policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring credentials to which they are not entitled. Non-default values for initLifetime and acceptLifetime cannot always be honored by the underlying mechanisms, thus callers should be prepared to call  {@link #getRemainingInitLifetime(Oid) getRemainingInitLifetime} and {@link #getRemainingAcceptLifetime(Oid) getRemainingAcceptLifetime} on the credential.\n * @param name the name of the principal for whom this credential is tobe acquired.  Use \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e to specify the default principal.\n * @param initLifetime the number of seconds that the credential elementshould remain valid for initiating of security contexts. Use  {@link GSSCredential#INDEFINITE_LIFETIME GSSCredential.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME}to request that the credentials have the maximum permitted lifetime for this.  Use  {@link GSSCredential#DEFAULT_LIFETIME GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME} to request default credential lifetimefor this.\n * @param acceptLifetime the number of seconds that the credentialelement should remain valid for accepting security contexts. Use  {@link GSSCredential#INDEFINITE_LIFETIME GSSCredential.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME}to request that the credentials have the maximum permitted lifetime for this.  Use  {@link GSSCredential#DEFAULT_LIFETIME GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME} to request default credential lifetimefor this.\n * @param mech the mechanism over which the credential is to be acquired.\n * @param usage the usage mode that this credentialelement should add to the credential.
