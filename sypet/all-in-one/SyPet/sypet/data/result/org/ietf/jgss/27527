In general, the \u003ccode\u003eGSSName\u003c/code\u003e object created  will contain multiple representations of the name, one for each mechanism that is supported; two examples that are exceptions to this are when the namespace type parameter indicates NT_EXPORT_NAME or when the GSS-API implementation is not multi-mechanism. It is not recommended to use this method with a NT_EXPORT_NAME type because representing a previously exported name consisting of abitrary bytes as a String might cause problems with character encoding schemes. In such cases it is recommended that the bytes be passed in directly to the overloaded form of this method  {@link #createName(byte[],Oid) createName}.\n * @param nameStr the string representing a printable form of the name tocreate.\n * @param nameType the Oid specifying the namespace of the printable namesupplied. \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e can be used to specify that a mechanism specific default printable syntax should be assumed by each mechanism that examines nameStr.
