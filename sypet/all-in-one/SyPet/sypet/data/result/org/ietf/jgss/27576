The method will return a token with the application supplied data and a cryptographic MIC over it.

The underlying mechanism that is used in the call may not be able to provide the privacy service.  It sets the actual privacy service that it does provide in this MessageProp object which the caller should then query upon return.  If the mechanism is not able to provide the requested QOP, it throws a GSSException with the BAD_QOP code.\u003cp\u003e Since some application-level protocols may wish to use tokens emitted by wrap to provide \"secure framing\", implementations should support the wrapping of zero-length messages.\u003cp\u003e The application will be responsible for sending the token to the peer.\n * @param inBuf application data to be protected.\n * @param offset the offset within the inBuf where the data begins.\n * @param len the length of the data\n * @param msgProp instance of MessageProp that is used by theapplication to set the desired QOP and privacy state.
