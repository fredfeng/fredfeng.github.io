This method attempts to acquire credentials for each of the mechanisms specified in the array called mechs.  To determine the list of mechanisms for which the acquisition of credentials succeeded, the caller should use the  {@link GSSCredential#getMechs() GSSCredential.getMechs} method.\u003cp\u003eGSS-API mechanism providers must impose a local access-control policy on callers to prevent unauthorized callers from acquiring credentials to which they are not entitled. The kinds of permissions needed by different mechanism providers will be documented on a per-mechanism basis. A failed permission check might cause a  {@link java.lang.SecurityException SecurityException} to be thrown fromthis method.\u003cp\u003e Non-default values for lifetime cannot always be honored by the underlying mechanisms, thus applications should be prepared to call {@link GSSCredential#getRemainingLifetime() getRemainingLifetime}on the returned credential.\u003cp\u003e\n * @param name the name of the principal for whom this credential is tobe acquired.  Use \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e to specify the default principal.\n * @param lifetime The number of seconds that credentials should remainvalid.  Use  {@link GSSCredential#INDEFINITE_LIFETIME GSSCredential.INDEFINITE_LIFETIME} to request that the credentialshave the maximum permitted lifetime.  Use  {@link GSSCredential#DEFAULT_LIFETIME GSSCredential.DEFAULT_LIFETIME} torequest default credential lifetime.\n * @param mechs an array of Oid\u0027s indicating the mechanisms over whichthe credential is to be acquired.  Use \u003ccode\u003e(Oid[]) null\u003c/code\u003e for requesting a system specific default set of mechanisms.\n * @param usage The intended usage for this credential object. The valueof this parameter must be one of: {@link GSSCredential#INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT GSSCredential.INITIATE_AND_ACCEPT}, {@link GSSCredential#ACCEPT_ONLY GSSCredential.ACCEPT_ONLY}, and {@link GSSCredential#INITIATE_ONLY GSSCredential.INITIATE_ONLY}.\n * @return a GSSCredential of the requested type.\n * @see GSSCredential\n * @throws GSSException containing the followingmajor error codes: {@link GSSException#BAD_MECH GSSException.BAD_MECH}, {@link GSSException#BAD_NAMETYPE GSSException.BAD_NAMETYPE}, {@link GSSException#BAD_NAME GSSException.BAD_NAME}, {@link GSSException#CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED GSSException.CREDENTIALS_EXPIRED}, {@link GSSException#NO_CRED GSSException.NO_CRED}, {@link GSSException#FAILURE GSSException.FAILURE}\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"lifetim":6,"acquir":5,"need":1,"second":1,"permit":1,"sexcept":13,"credentialshav":1,"type":1,"must":2,"specifi":2,"remainvalid":1,"fail":1,"fromthi":1,"request":3,"permiss":2,"tobe":1,"control":1,"except":2,"thrown":1,"succeed":1,"torequest":1,"honor":1,"creat":1,"alway":1,"number":1,"prevent":1,"polici":1,"provid":2,"scredenti":15,"prepar":1,"whichth":1,"non":1,"valueof":1,"entitl":1,"system":1,"maximum":1,"contain":1,"determin":1,"will":1,"princip":2,"array":2,"caller":3,"attempt":1,"call":2,"might":1,"one":1,"link":14,"acquisit":1,"unauthor":1,"use":5,"object":1,"lang":1,"applic":1,"kind":1,"document":1,"indic":1,"oid":2,"factori":1,"followingmajor":1,"name":2,"valu":1,"mech":4,"error":1,"credenti":11,"check":1,"thus":1,"paramet":1,"list":1,"access":1,"impos":1,"differ":1,"specif":1,"caus":1,"secur":2,"remain":2,"per":1,"mechan":9,"method":4,"java":1,"usag":2,"local":1,"intend":1,"basi":1},"maxFreq":15,"totalTerms":176},"loc":0}
