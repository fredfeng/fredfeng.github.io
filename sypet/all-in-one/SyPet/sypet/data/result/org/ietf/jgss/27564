If the name is not an MN, implementations may throw a GSSException with the NAME_NOT_MN status code.  If an implementation chooses not to throw an exception, it should use some system specific default mechanism to canonicalize the name and then export it. Structurally, an exported name object consists of a header containing an OID identifying the mechanism that authenticated the name, and a trailer containing the name itself, where the syntax of the trailer is defined by the individual mechanism specification. The format of the header of the output buffer is specified in RFC 2743.\u003cp\u003e The exported name is useful when used in large access control lists where the overhead of creating a \u003ccode\u003eGSSName\u003c/code\u003e object on each name and invoking the equals method on each name from the ACL may be prohibitive.\u003cp\u003e Exported names may be re-imported by using the byte array factory method  {@link GSSManager#createName(byte[],Oid) GSSManager.createName} and specifying the NT_EXPORT_NAME as the nametype object identifier. The resulting \u003ccode\u003eGSSName\u003c/code\u003e name will also be a MN.\u003cp\u003e\n * @return a byte[] containing the exported name.
