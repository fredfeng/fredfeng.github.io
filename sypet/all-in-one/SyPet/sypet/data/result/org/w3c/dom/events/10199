If called multiple times the final invocation takes precedence. If called from a subclass of \u003ccode\u003eEvent\u003c/code\u003e interface only the values specified in the \u003ccode\u003einitEvent\u003c/code\u003e method are modified, all other attributes are left unchanged.\n * @param eventTypeArg Specifies the event type.
