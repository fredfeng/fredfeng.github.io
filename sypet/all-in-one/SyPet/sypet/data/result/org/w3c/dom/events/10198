If, during any stage of event flow, the \u003ccode\u003epreventDefault\u003c/code\u003e method is called the event is canceled. Any default action associated with the event will not occur. Calling this method for a non-cancelable event has no effect. Once \u003ccode\u003epreventDefault\u003c/code\u003e has been called it will remain in effect throughout the remainder of the event\u0027s propagation.
