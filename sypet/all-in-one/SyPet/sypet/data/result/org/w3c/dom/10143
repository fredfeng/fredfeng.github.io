If an attribute with that name is already present in the element, its value is changed to be that of the value parameter. This value is a simple string; it is not parsed as it is being set. So any markup (such as syntax to be recognized as an entity reference) is treated as literal text, and needs to be appropriately escaped by the implementation when it is written out. In order to assign an attribute value that contains entity references, the user must create an \u003ccode\u003eAttr\u003c/code\u003e node plus any \u003ccode\u003eText\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eEntityReference\u003c/code\u003e nodes, build the appropriate subtree, and use \u003ccode\u003esetAttributeNode\u003c/code\u003e to assign it as the value of an attribute. \u003cbr\u003eTo set an attribute with a qualified name and namespace URI, use the \u003ccode\u003esetAttributeNS\u003c/code\u003e method.\n * @param name The name of the attribute to create or alter.\n * @param value Value to set in string form.\n * @exception DOMException INVALID_CHARACTER_ERR: Raised if the specified name is not an XML name according to the XML version in use specified in the \u003ccode\u003eDocument.xmlVersion\u003c/code\u003e attribute. \u003cbr\u003eNO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR: Raised if this node is readonly.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"markup":1,"assign":2,"simpl":1,"must":1,"specifi":2,"namespac":1,"readon":1,"refer":3,"recogn":1,"element":1,"plus":1,"text":2,"liter":1,"except":1,"form":1,"creat":2,"xml":1,"attr":1,"present":1,"syntax":1,"node":4,"entiti":3,"contain":1,"treat":1,"mexcept":1,"use":3,"add":1,"build":1,"escap":1,"version":2,"document":1,"attribut":10,"rais":2,"order":1,"written":1,"name":6,"valu":7,"subtre":1,"paramet":1,"accord":1,"alter":1,"appropri":2,"string":2,"alreadi":1,"method":1,"chang":1,"pars":1,"user":1,"qualifi":1},"maxFreq":10,"totalTerms":87},"loc":0}
