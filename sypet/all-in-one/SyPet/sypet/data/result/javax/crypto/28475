The generated parameters can be retrieved using {@link #getParameters() getParameters} or{@link #getIV() getIV} (if the parameter is an IV).\u003cp\u003eIf this cipher requires algorithm parameters that cannot be derived from the input parameters, and there are no reasonable provider-specific default values, initialization will necessarily fail. \u003cp\u003eIf this cipher (including its underlying feedback or padding scheme) requires any random bytes (e.g., for parameter generation), it will get them using the  {@link SecureRandom \u003ccode\u003eSecureRandom\u003c/code\u003e}implementation of the highest-priority installed provider as the source of randomness.
