It is displayed at the location specified by the application and is modal. If the specification is invalid or would make the dialog not visible it will be displayed at a location determined by the implementation. The dialog blocks its calling thread and is application modal. \u003cp\u003e The dialog may include a tab panel with custom UI lazily obtained from the PrintService\u0027s ServiceUIFactory when the PrintService is browsed. The dialog will attempt to locate a MAIN_UIROLE first as a JComponent, then as a Panel. If there is no ServiceUIFactory or no matching role the custom tab will be empty or not visible. \u003cp\u003e The dialog returns the print service selected by the user if the user OK\u0027s the dialog and null if the user cancels the dialog. \u003cp\u003e An application must pass in an array of print services to browse. The array must be non-null and non-empty. Typically an application will pass in only PrintServices capable of printing a particular document flavor. \u003cp\u003e An application may pass in a PrintService to be initially displayed. A non-null parameter must be included in the array of browsable services. If this parameter is null a service is chosen by the implementation. \u003cp\u003e An application may optionally pass in the flavor to be printed. If this is non-null choices presented to the user can be better validated against those supported by the services. An application must pass in a PrintRequestAttributeSet for returning user choices. On calling the PrintRequestAttributeSet may be empty, or may contain application-specified values. \u003cp\u003e These are used to set the initial settings for the initially displayed print service. Values which are not supported by the print service are ignored. As the user browses print services, attributes and values are copied to the new display. If a user browses a print service which does not support a particular attribute-value, the default for that service is used as the new value to be copied. \u003cp\u003e If the user cancels the dialog, the returned attributes will not reflect any changes made by the user. A typical basic usage of this method may be : \u003cpre\u003e PrintService[] services \u003d PrintServiceLookup.lookupPrintServices( DocFlavor.INPUT_STREAM.JPEG, null); PrintRequestAttributeSet attributes \u003d new HashPrintRequestAttributeSet(); if (services.length \u003e 0) { PrintService service \u003d  ServiceUI.printDialog(null, 50, 50, services, services[0], null, attributes); if (service !\u003d null) { ... print ... } } \u003c/pre\u003e \u003cp\u003e\n * @param gc used to select screen. null means primary or default screen.\n * @param x location of dialog including border in screen coordinates\n * @param y location of dialog including border in screen coordinates\n * @param services to be browsable, must be non-null.\n * @param defaultService - initial PrintService to display.\n * @param flavor - the flavor to be printed, or null.\n * @param attributes on input is the initial application suppliedpreferences.
