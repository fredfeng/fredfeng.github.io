The output stream is created and managed by the application. It is the application\u0027s responsibility to close the stream and to ensure that this Printer is not reused. The application should not close this stream until any print job created from the printer is complete. Doing so earlier may generate a \u003ccode\u003ePrinterException\u003c/code\u003e and an event indicating that the job failed. \u003cp\u003e Whereas a \u003ccode\u003ePrintService\u003c/code\u003e connected to a physical printer can be reused, a \u003ccode\u003eStreamPrintService\u003c/code\u003e connected to a stream cannot. The underlying \u003ccode\u003eStreamPrintService\u003c/code\u003e may be disposed by the print system with the  {@link StreamPrintService#dispose() dispose} methodbefore returning from the {@link DocPrintJob#print(Doc,javax.print.attribute.PrintRequestAttributeSet) print}method of \u003ccode\u003eDocPrintJob\u003c/code\u003e so that the print system knows this printer is no longer usable. This is equivalent to a physical printer going offline - permanently. Applications may supply a null print stream to create a queryable service. It is not valid to create a PrintJob for such a stream. Implementations which allocate resources on construction should examine the stream and may wish to only allocate resources if the stream is non-null. \u003cp\u003e\n * @param out destination stream for generated output.\n * @return a PrintService which will generate the format specified by theDocFlavor supported by this Factory.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"wish":1,"servic":8,"reus":2,"specifi":2,"close":2,"fail":1,"equival":1,"event":1,"javax":1,"request":1,"longer":1,"examin":1,"wherea":1,"except":1,"support":1,"respons":1,"creat":4,"flavor":1,"job":5,"format":1,"non":1,"system":2,"earlier":1,"offlin":1,"will":1,"output":3,"go":1,"alloc":2,"valid":1,"stream":14,"connect":2,"link":2,"queryabl":1,"applic":4,"ensur":1,"resourc":2,"attribut":2,"indic":1,"factori":1,"usabl":1,"complet":1,"may":4,"manag":1,"physic":2,"suppli":1,"know":1,"print":19,"printer":6,"methodbefor":1,"generat":3,"dispos":3,"method":1,"construct":1,"destin":1,"perman":1},"maxFreq":19,"totalTerms":127},"loc":0}
