Since all the fields except seconds are restricted to hold integers, any fraction produced by the computation will be carried down toward the next lower unit. For example, if you multiply \"P1D\" (1 day) with \"0.5\", then it will be 0.5 day, which will be carried down to \"PT12H\" (12 hours). When fractions of month cannot be meaningfully carried down to days, or year to months, this will cause an {@link IllegalStateException} to be thrown.For example if you multiple one month by 0.5.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e To avoid  {@link IllegalStateException}, use the  {@link #normalizeWith(Calendar)} method to remove the yearsand months fields.\n * @param factor to multiply by\n * @return returns a non-null valid \u003ccode\u003eDuration\u003c/code\u003e object\n * @throws IllegalStateException if operation produces fraction inthe months field.\n * @throws NullPointerException if the \u003ccode\u003efactor\u003c/code\u003e parameter is\u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"lower":1,"second":2,"normal":1,"perform":1,"carri":3,"avoid":1,"time":1,"toward":1,"oper":2,"precis":1,"longer":1,"year":1,"except":6,"thrown":1,"multipl":1,"whose":1,"hold":1,"remov":1,"immut":1,"restrict":1,"non":1,"will":5,"month":8,"pointer":1,"comput":3,"day":3,"big":1,"valid":1,"simpli":1,"yearsand":1,"link":4,"next":1,"one":1,"state":4,"use":1,"object":3,"decim":1,"durat":5,"inth":1,"multipli":3,"valu":3,"calendar":1,"min":1,"fraction":3,"paramet":1,"produc":2,"factor":3,"hour":1,"meaning":1,"illeg":4,"field":5,"unit":1,"caus":1,"pre":2,"exampl":3,"method":2,"chang":1,"integ":1},"maxFreq":8,"totalTerms":114},"loc":0}
