This static method creates a new factory instance This method uses the following ordered lookup procedure to determine the \u003ccode\u003eSAXParserFactory\u003c/code\u003e implementation class to load: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e Use the \u003ccode\u003ejavax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory\u003c/code\u003e system property. \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Use the properties file \"lib/jaxp.properties\" in the JRE directory. This configuration file is in standard \u003ccode\u003ejava.util.Properties \u003c/code\u003e format and contains the fully qualified name of the implementation class with the key being the system property defined above. The jaxp.properties file is read only once by the JAXP implementation and it\u0027s values are then cached for future use.  If the file does not exist when the first attempt is made to read from it, no further attempts are made to check for its existence.  It is not possible to change the value of any property in jaxp.properties after it has been read for the first time. \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Use the Services API (as detailed in the JAR specification), if available, to determine the classname. The Services API will look for a classname in the file \u003ccode\u003eMETA-INF/services/javax.xml.parsers.SAXParserFactory\u003c/code\u003e in jars available to the runtime. \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003e Platform default \u003ccode\u003eSAXParserFactory\u003c/code\u003e instance. \u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e Once an application has obtained a reference to a \u003ccode\u003eSAXParserFactory\u003c/code\u003e it can use the factory to configure and obtain parser instances. \u003ch2\u003eTip for Trouble-shooting\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cp\u003eSetting the \u003ccode\u003ejaxp.debug\u003c/code\u003e system property will cause this method to print a lot of debug messages to \u003ccode\u003eSystem.err\u003c/code\u003e about what it is doing and where it is looking at.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e If you have problems loading  {@link DocumentBuilder}s, try:\u003c/p\u003e \u003cpre\u003e java -Djaxp.debug\u003d1 YourProgram .... \u003c/pre\u003e\n * @return A new instance of a SAXParserFactory.\n * @throws FactoryConfigurationError if the implementation isnot available or cannot be instantiated.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"detail":1,"instanti":1,"servic":3,"possibl":1,"lookup":1,"tip":1,"time":1,"refer":1,"jar":1,"file":5,"javax":2,"djaxp":1,"key":1,"follow":1,"platform":1,"troubl":1,"creat":1,"runtim":1,"builder":1,"avail":3,"xml":2,"format":1,"procedur":1,"instanc":6,"configur":3,"system":4,"obtain":3,"jaxp":4,"shoot":1,"program":1,"determin":2,"contain":1,"will":2,"lot":1,"classnam":2,"load":2,"properti":9,"parser":3,"util":1,"attempt":2,"defin":1,"directori":1,"xparser":7,"link":1,"made":2,"use":6,"debug":3,"applic":1,"document":1,"isnot":1,"order":1,"factori":10,"name":1,"read":3,"valu":2,"exist":2,"look":2,"futur":1,"error":1,"standard":1,"check":1,"messag":1,"problem":1,"fulli":1,"cach":1,"print":1,"specif":1,"caus":1,"lib":1,"pre":2,"err":1,"method":3,"java":2,"chang":1,"first":2,"qualifi":1},"maxFreq":10,"totalTerms":149},"loc":12}
