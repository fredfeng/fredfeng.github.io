If the handler throws an exception, it will abort the schema compilation and the same exception will be thrown from this method. Also, after an error is reported to a handler, the callee is allowed to abort the further processing by throwing it.

The same result would be achieved if all these sources were imported, using appropriate values for schemaLocation and namespace, into a single schema document with a different targetNamespace and no components of its own, if the import elements were given in the same order as the sources.  Section 4.2.3 of the XML Schema recommendation describes the options processors have in this regard.  While a processor should be consistent in its treatment of JAXP schema sources and XML Schema imports, the behaviour between JAXP-compliant parsers may vary; in particular, parsers may choose to ignore all but the first \u0026lt;import\u003e for a given namespace, regardless of information provided in schemaLocation. \u003cp\u003e If the parsed set of schemas includes error(s) as specified in the section 5.1 of the XML Schema spec, then the error must be reported to the  {@link ErrorHandler}. \u003ch2\u003eRELAX NG\u003c/h2\u003e \u003cp\u003eFor RELAX NG, this method must throw  {@link UnsupportedOperationException}if \u003ccode\u003eschemas.length!\u003d1\u003c/code\u003e.\n * @param schemas inputs to be parsed.  {@link SchemaFactory} is requiredto recognize  {@link javax.xml.transform.sax.SAXSource}, {@link StreamSource}, {@link javax.xml.transform.stax.StAXSource}, and  {@link javax.xml.transform.dom.DOMSource}.
