If there are any reference parameters in the \u003ccode\u003eendpointReference\u003c/code\u003e, then those reference parameters MUST appear as SOAP headers, indicating them to be reference parameters, on all messages sent to the endpoint. The parameter  \u003ccode\u003eserviceEndpointInterface\u003c/code\u003e specifies the service endpoint interface that is supported by the returned proxy. The parameter \u003ccode\u003eendpointReference\u003c/code\u003e specifies the endpoint that will be invoked by the returned proxy. In the implementation of this method, the JAX-WS runtime system takes the responsibility of selecting a protocol binding (and a port) and configuring the proxy accordingly from the WSDL metadata of the \u003ccode\u003eserviceEndpointInterface\u003c/code\u003e and the \u003ccode\u003eEndpointReference\u003c/code\u003e. For this method to successfully return a proxy, WSDL metadata MUST be available and the \u003ccode\u003eendpointReference\u003c/code\u003e MUST contain an implementation understood \u003ccode\u003eserviceName\u003c/code\u003e metadata.\n * @param endpointReference the EndpointReference that willbe invoked by the returned proxy.\n * @param serviceEndpointInterface Service endpoint interface\n * @param features  A list of WebServiceFeatures to configure on theproxy.
