This method is called automatically when {@link SOAPMessage#writeTo(OutputStream)} is  called. However, ifchanges are made to a message that was received or to one that has already been sent, the method \u003ccode\u003esaveChanges\u003c/code\u003e needs to be called explicitly in order to save the changes. The method \u003ccode\u003esaveChanges\u003c/code\u003e also generates any changes that can be read back (for example, a MessageId in profiles that support a message id).
