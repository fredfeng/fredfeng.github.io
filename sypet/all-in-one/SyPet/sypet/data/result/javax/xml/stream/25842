This static method creates a new factory instance. This method uses the following ordered lookup procedure to determine the XMLEventFactory implementation class to load: Use the javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory system property. Use the properties file \"lib/stax.properties\" in the JRE directory. This configuration file is in standard java.util.Properties format and contains the fully qualified name of the implementation class with the key being the system property defined above. Use the Services API (as detailed in the JAR specification), if available, to determine the classname. The Services API will look for a classname in the file META-INF/services/javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory in jars available to the runtime. Platform default XMLEventFactory instance. Once an application has obtained a reference to a XMLEventFactory it can use the factory to configure and obtain stream instances. Note that this is a new method that replaces the deprecated newInstance() method. No changes in behavior are defined by this replacement method relative to the deprecated method.\n * @throws FactoryConfigurationError if an instance of this factory cannot be loaded\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"detail":1,"deprec":2,"servic":3,"lookup":1,"refer":1,"file":3,"javax":2,"jar":1,"relat":1,"key":1,"follow":1,"platform":1,"creat":2,"runtim":1,"xml":2,"avail":2,"format":1,"procedur":1,"instanc":6,"configur":3,"system":2,"obtain":2,"determin":2,"contain":1,"will":1,"load":2,"classnam":2,"properti":5,"util":1,"defin":2,"stream":3,"directori":1,"behavior":1,"use":5,"applic":1,"order":1,"factori":11,"name":1,"levent":5,"note":1,"look":1,"stax":1,"error":1,"standard":1,"fulli":1,"specif":1,"lib":1,"replac":2,"java":1,"method":6,"chang":1,"qualifi":1},"maxFreq":11,"totalTerms":104},"loc":3}
