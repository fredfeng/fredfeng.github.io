In mono mode, the channel synthesizes only one note at a time.  In poly mode (identical to mono mode off), the channel can synthesize multiple notes simultaneously. The default is mono off (poly mode on). \u003cp\u003e \"Mono\" is short for the word \"monophonic,\" which in this context is opposed to the word \"polyphonic\" and refers to a single synthesizer voice per MIDI channel.  It has nothing to do with how many audio channels there might be (as in \"monophonic\" versus \"stereophonic\" recordings). It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support mono mode.
