The default is for local control to be on.  The \"on\" setting means that if a device is capable of both synthesizing sound and transmitting MIDI messages, it will synthesize sound in response to the note-on and note-off messages that it itself transmits.  It will also respond to messages received from other transmitting devices. The \"off\" setting means that the synthesizer will ignore its own transmitted MIDI messages, but not those received from other devices. It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support local control.
