Channel pressure indicates how hard the keyboard player is depressing the entire keyboard.  This can be the maximum or average of the per-key pressure-sensor values, as set by \u003ccode\u003esetPolyPressure\u003c/code\u003e.  More commonly, it is a measurement of a single sensor on a device that doesn\u0027t implement polyphonic key pressure.  Pressure can be used to control various aspects of the sound, as described under  {@link #setPolyPressure(int,int) setPolyPressure}. It is possible that the underlying synthesizer does not support this MIDI message.
