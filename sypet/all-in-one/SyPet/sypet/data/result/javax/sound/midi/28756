The return value is represented with 7 bits. For 14-bit controllers, the MSB and LSB controller value needs to be obtained separately. For example, the 14-bit value of the volume controller can be calculated by multiplying the value of controller 7 (0x07, channel volume MSB) with 128 and adding the value of controller 39 (0x27, channel volume LSB). If the device does not support setting a specific controller, this method returns 0 for that controller.
