The division type must be one of the recognized MIDI timing types.  For tempo-based timing, \u003ccode\u003edivisionType\u003c/code\u003e is PPQ (pulses per quarter note) and the resolution is specified in ticks per beat.  For SMTPE timing, \u003ccode\u003edivisionType\u003c/code\u003e specifies the number of frames per second and the resolution is specified in ticks per frame. The sequence will be initialized with the number of tracks specified by \u003ccode\u003enumTracks\u003c/code\u003e. These tracks are initially empty (i.e. they contain only the meta-event End of Track). The tracks may be retrieved for editing using the \u003ccode\u003e {@link #getTracks}\u003c/code\u003e method.  Additional tracks may be added, or existing tracks removed, using \u003ccode\u003e {@link #createTrack}\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e {@link #deleteTrack}\u003c/code\u003e.\n * @param divisionType the timing division type (PPQ or one of the SMPTE types)\n * @param resolution the timing resolution\n * @param numTracks the initial number of tracks in the sequence.\n * @throws InvalidMidiDataException if \u003ccode\u003edivisionType\u003c/code\u003e is not valid\n * @see #PPQ\n * @see #SMPTE_24\n * @see #SMPTE_25\n * @see #SMPTE_30DROP\n * @see #SMPTE_30\n * @see #getDivisionType\n * @see #getResolution\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"valid":1,"second":1,"delet":1,"link":3,"one":2,"data":1,"tempo":1,"use":2,"type":10,"meta":1,"must":1,"specifi":5,"puls":1,"resolut":6,"midi":1,"time":7,"invalid":1,"event":1,"sequenc":4,"initi":3,"exist":1,"recogn":1,"end":1,"note":1,"addit":1,"except":1,"may":2,"beat":1,"creat":1,"remov":1,"edit":1,"track":13,"number":4,"empti":1,"tick":2,"num":2,"frame":2,"per":4,"retriev":1,"contain":1,"base":1,"will":1,"ad":1,"method":1,"construct":1,"divis":8,"quarter":1},"maxFreq":13,"totalTerms":109},"loc":20}
