To be kept in mind that if an MBean is unregistered and the purge not done immediately, if the ObjectName is reused and assigned to another MBean referenced in a relation, calling manually this purgeRelations() method will cause trouble, as will consider the ObjectName as corresponding to the unregistered MBean, not seeing the new one. \u003cP\u003eThe behavior depends on the cardinality of the role where the unregistered MBean is referenced: \u003cP\u003e- if removing one MBean reference in the role makes its number of references less than the minimum degree, the relation has to be removed. \u003cP\u003e- if the remaining number of references after removing the MBean reference is still in the cardinality range, keep the relation and update it calling its handleMBeanUnregistration() callback.\n * @exception RelationServiceNotRegisteredException  if the RelationService is not registered in the MBean Server.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":1,"mbean":9,"assign":1,"servic":2,"maintain":1,"reus":1,"referenc":3,"notif":1,"refer":4,"rang":1,"relat":10,"role":2,"except":2,"troubl":1,"consist":1,"done":1,"remov":3,"number":2,"unregistr":2,"degre":1,"purg":5,"flag":3,"updat":1,"will":2,"make":1,"call":4,"minimum":1,"correspond":1,"behavior":1,"one":2,"object":2,"anoth":1,"automat":1,"consid":1,"cardin":2,"name":2,"regist":2,"immedi":1,"valu":1,"mind":1,"less":1,"kept":1,"depend":2,"true":1,"receiv":1,"still":1,"handl":1,"manual":1,"either":1,"caus":1,"remain":1,"callback":1,"server":1,"method":2,"unregist":3,"user":1,"keep":1},"maxFreq":10,"totalTerms":105},"loc":0}
