For example, the list of valid signature algorithms may restrict the type of certificates that can used during TrustManager decisions, or the maximum TLS fragment packet sizes can be resized to better support the network environment. \u003cp\u003e This method provides early access to the  {@code SSLSession} beingconstructed.  Depending on how far the handshake has progressed, some data may not yet be available for use.  For example, if a remote server will be sending a Certificate chain, but that chain has yet not been processed, the  {@code getPeerCertificates}method of  {@code SSLSession} will throw aSSLPeerUnverifiedException.  Once that chain has been processed, {@code getPeerCertificates} will return the proper value.\n * @see SSLSocket\n * @see SSLSession\n * @see ExtendedSSLSession\n * @see X509ExtendedKeyManager\n * @see X509ExtendedTrustManager\n * @return null if this instance is not currently handshaking, orif the current handshake has not progressed far enough to create a basic SSLSession.
