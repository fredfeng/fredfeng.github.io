Common reasons include a need to use new encryption keys, to change cipher suites, or to initiate a new session.  To force complete reauthentication, the current session could be invalidated before starting this handshake. \u003cP\u003e If data has already been sent on the connection, it continues to flow during this handshake.  When the handshake completes, this will be signaled with an event. This method is synchronous for the initial handshake on a connection and returns when the negotiated handshake is complete.
