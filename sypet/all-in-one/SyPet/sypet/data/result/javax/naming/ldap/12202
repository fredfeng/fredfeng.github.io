This method is a convenience method for creating a new instance of this context for the purposes of multithreaded access. For example, if multiple threads want to use different context request controls, each thread may use this method to get its own copy of this context and set/get context request controls without having to synchronize with other threads. \u003cp\u003e The new context has the same environment properties and connection request controls as this context. See the class description for details. Implementations might also allow this context and the new context to share the same network connection or other resources if doing so does not impede the independence of either context.\n * @param requestControls The possibly null request controlsto use for the new context. If null, the context is initialized with no request controls.\n * @return A non-null \u003ctt\u003eLdapContext\u003c/tt\u003e instance.\n * @exception NamingException If an error occurred while creatingthe new instance.\n * @see InitialLdapContext\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"might":1,"detail":1,"allow":1,"connect":2,"possibl":1,"use":4,"imped":1,"network":1,"copi":1,"independ":1,"resourc":1,"share":1,"name":1,"request":7,"thread":3,"purpos":1,"multithread":1,"initi":3,"conveni":1,"want":1,"control":6,"except":2,"may":1,"error":1,"multipl":1,"creat":2,"environ":1,"descript":1,"access":1,"controlsto":1,"without":1,"non":1,"instanc":5,"differ":1,"either":1,"creatingth":1,"ldap":2,"context":14,"exampl":1,"method":3,"properti":1,"also":1,"occur":1},"maxFreq":14,"totalTerms":84},"loc":0}
