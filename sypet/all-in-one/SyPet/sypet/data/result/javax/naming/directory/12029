An attribute\u0027s syntax definition specifies the format of the attribute\u0027s value(s). Note that this is different from the attribute value\u0027s representation as a Java object. Syntax definition refers to the directory\u0027s notion of \u003cem\u003esyntax\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cp\u003e For example, even though a value might be a Java String object, its directory syntax might be \"Printable String\" or \"Telephone Number\". Or a value might be a byte array, and its directory syntax is \"JPEG\" or \"Certificate\". For example, if this attribute\u0027s syntax is \"JPEG\", this method would return the syntax definition for \"JPEG\". \u003cp\u003e The information that you can retrieve from a syntax definition is directory-dependent. \u003cp\u003e If an implementation does not support schemas, it should throw OperationNotSupportedException.
