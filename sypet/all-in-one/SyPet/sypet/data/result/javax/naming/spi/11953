If a factory implements \u003ctt\u003eDirStateFactory\u003c/tt\u003e, \u003ctt\u003eDirectoryManager\u003c/tt\u003e invokes this method; otherwise, it invokes \u003ctt\u003eStateFactory.getStateToBind()\u003c/tt\u003e. It does this until a factory produces a non-null answer. \u003cp\u003e When an exception is thrown by a factory, the exception is passed on to the caller of \u003ctt\u003eDirectoryManager.getStateToBind()\u003c/tt\u003e. The search for other factories that may produce a non-null answer is halted. A factory should only throw an exception if it is sure that it is the only intended factory and that no other factories should be tried. If this factory cannot create an object using the arguments supplied, it should return null. \u003cp\u003e The \u003ccode\u003ename\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003enameCtx\u003c/code\u003e parameters may optionally be used to specify the name of the object being created. See the description of \"Name and Context Parameters\" in {@link ObjectFactory#getObjectInstance ObjectFactory.getObjectInstance()}for details. If a factory uses \u003ccode\u003enameCtx\u003c/code\u003e it should synchronize its use against concurrent access, since context implementations are not guaranteed to be thread-safe. \u003cp\u003e The \u003ctt\u003ename\u003c/tt\u003e, \u003ctt\u003einAttrs\u003c/tt\u003e, and \u003ctt\u003eenvironment\u003c/tt\u003e parameters are owned by the caller. The implementation will not modify these objects or keep references to them, although it may keep references to clones or copies. The object returned by this method is owned by the caller. The implementation will not subsequently modify it. It will contain either a new \u003ctt\u003eAttributes\u003c/tt\u003e object that is likewise owned by the caller, or a reference to the original \u003ctt\u003einAttrs\u003c/tt\u003e parameter.\n * @param obj A possibly null object whose state is to be retrieved.\n * @param name The name of this object relative to \u003ccode\u003enameCtx\u003c/code\u003e,or null if no name is specified.\n * @param nameCtx The context relative to which the \u003ccode\u003ename\u003c/code\u003eparameter is specified, or null if \u003ccode\u003ename\u003c/code\u003e is relative to the default initial context.\n * @param environment The possibly null environment tobe used in the creation of the object\u0027s state.\n * @param inAttrs The possibly null attributes to be bound with the object.The factory must not modify \u003ctt\u003einAttrs\u003c/tt\u003e.\n * @return A \u003ctt\u003eResult\u003c/tt\u003e containing the object\u0027s state for bindingand the corresponding attributes to be bound; null if the object don\u0027t use this factory.\n * @exception NamingException If this factory encountered an exceptionwhile attempting to get the object\u0027s state, and no other factories are to be tried.\n * @see DirectoryManager#getStateToBind\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"detail":1,"possibl":3,"must":1,"copi":1,"specifi":3,"although":1,"given":1,"refer":3,"search":1,"thread":1,"relat":3,"ctx":4,"tobe":1,"option":1,"sure":1,"argument":1,"clone":1,"thrown":1,"except":5,"whose":1,"creat":2,"invok":2,"environ":3,"answer":2,"descript":1,"attr":4,"non":2,"instanc":2,"likewis":1,"contain":2,"will":3,"load":1,"attempt":1,"caller":4,"otherwis":1,"result":1,"creation":1,"directori":4,"correspond":1,"concurr":1,"link":1,"state":13,"use":6,"object":18,"transform":1,"attribut":4,"dir":1,"factori":18,"name":14,"exceptionwhil":1,"initi":1,"subsequ":1,"safe":1,"may":3,"manag":4,"guarante":1,"origin":1,"paramet":5,"produc":2,"suppli":1,"access":1,"pass":1,"either":1,"encount":1,"retriev":2,"modifi":3,"context":4,"obj":1,"method":2,"halt":1,"intend":1,"bindingand":1,"bind":6,"success":1,"bound":2,"keep":2},"maxFreq":18,"totalTerms":201},"loc":0}
