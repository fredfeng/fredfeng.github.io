The event source of those events is this context. See the class description for a discussion on event source and target. See the descriptions of the constants \u003ctt\u003eOBJECT_SCOPE\u003c/tt\u003e, \u003ctt\u003eONELEVEL_SCOPE\u003c/tt\u003e, and \u003ctt\u003eSUBTREE_SCOPE\u003c/tt\u003e to see how \u003ctt\u003escope\u003c/tt\u003e affects the registration. \u003cp\u003e \u003ctt\u003etarget\u003c/tt\u003e needs to name a context only when \u003ctt\u003escope\u003c/tt\u003e is \u003ctt\u003eONELEVEL_SCOPE\u003c/tt\u003e. \u003ctt\u003etarget\u003c/tt\u003e may name a non-context if \u003ctt\u003escope\u003c/tt\u003e is either \u003ctt\u003eOBJECT_SCOPE\u003c/tt\u003e or \u003ctt\u003eSUBTREE_SCOPE\u003c/tt\u003e.  Using \u003ctt\u003eSUBTREE_SCOPE\u003c/tt\u003e for a non-context might be useful, for example, if the caller does not know in advance whether \u003ctt\u003etarget\u003c/tt\u003e is a context and just wants to register interest in the (possibly degenerate subtree) rooted at \u003ctt\u003etarget\u003c/tt\u003e. \u003cp\u003e When the listener is notified of an event, the listener may in invoked in a thread other than the one in which \u003ctt\u003eaddNamingListener()\u003c/tt\u003e is executed. Care must be taken when multiple threads are accessing the same \u003ctt\u003eEventContext\u003c/tt\u003e concurrently.
