Regardless of whether a referral is encountered directly during a context operation, or indirectly, for example, during a search enumeration, the referral exception should provide a context at which to continue the operation. \u003cp\u003e The referral context is created using \u003ctt\u003eenv\u003c/tt\u003e as its environment properties. This method should be used instead of the no-arg overloaded form when the caller needs to use different environment properties for the referral context. It might need to do this, for example, when it needs to supply different authentication information to the referred server in order to create the referral context. \u003cp\u003e To continue the operation, the client program should re-invoke the method using the same arguments as the original invocation.\n * @param env The possibly null environment to use when retrieving thereferral context.
