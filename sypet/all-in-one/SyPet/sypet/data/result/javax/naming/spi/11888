The context implementation does this by first constructing a \u003ccode\u003eCannotProceedException\u003c/code\u003e containing information pinpointing how far it has proceeded.  It then obtains a continuation context from JNDI by calling \u003ccode\u003egetContinuationContext\u003c/code\u003e.  The context implementation should then resume the context operation by invoking the same operation on the continuation context, using the remainder of the name that has not yet been resolved. \u003cp\u003e Before making use of the \u003ctt\u003ecpe\u003c/tt\u003e parameter, this method updates the environment associated with that object by setting the value of the property \u003ca href\u003d\"#CPE\"\u003e\u003ctt\u003eCPE\u003c/tt\u003e\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ctt\u003ecpe\u003c/tt\u003e.
