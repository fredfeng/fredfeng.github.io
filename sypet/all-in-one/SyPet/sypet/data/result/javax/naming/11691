One can subsequently look up and perform operations on the foreign context using a composite name.  However, an attempt destroy the context using this composite name will fail with \u003ctt\u003eNotContextException\u003c/tt\u003e, because the foreign context is not a \"subcontext\" of the context in which it is bound. Instead, use \u003ctt\u003eunbind()\u003c/tt\u003e to remove the binding of the foreign context.
