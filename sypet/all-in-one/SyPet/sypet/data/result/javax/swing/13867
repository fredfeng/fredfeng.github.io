This is only a hint, and it is up to consumers that are requesting focus to honor this property. This is typically honored for mouse operations, but not keyboard operations. For example, look and feels could verify this property is true before requesting focus during a mouse operation. This would often times be used if you did not want a mouse press on a \u003ccode\u003eJComponent\u003c/code\u003e to steal focus, but did want the \u003ccode\u003eJComponent\u003c/code\u003e to be traversable via the keyboard. If you do not want this \u003ccode\u003eJComponent\u003c/code\u003e focusable at all, use the \u003ccode\u003esetFocusable\u003c/code\u003e method instead. \u003cp\u003e Please see \u003ca href\u003d\"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/focus.html\"\u003e How to Use the Focus Subsystem\u003c/a\u003e, a section in \u003cem\u003eThe Java Tutorial\u003c/em\u003e, for more information.\n * @param requestFocusEnabled indicates whether you want this\u003ccode\u003eJComponent\u003c/code\u003e to be focusable or not\n * @see \u003ca href\u003d\"../../java/awt/doc-files/FocusSpec.html\"\u003eFocus Specification\u003c/a\u003e\n * @see java.awt.Component#setFocusable\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"spec":1,"press":1,"com":1,"via":1,"typic":1,"use":3,"sun":1,"mous":3,"whether":2,"consum":1,"tutori":2,"jcompon":5,"time":1,"pleas":1,"indic":1,"oper":3,"file":1,"uisw":1,"request":4,"verifi":1,"focus":14,"href":2,"want":4,"travers":1,"look":1,"steal":1,"feel":1,"keyboard":2,"honor":2,"enabl":2,"true":1,"hint":2,"provid":1,"section":1,"misc":1,"inform":1,"specif":1,"awt":2,"compon":1,"http":1,"often":1,"book":1,"instead":1,"exampl":1,"subsystem":1,"html":2,"java":4,"method":1,"properti":2},"maxFreq":14,"totalTerms":91},"loc":3}
