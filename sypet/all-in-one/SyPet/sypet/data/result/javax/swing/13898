To unregister an existing binding you can either remove the binding from the \u003ccode\u003eActionMap/InputMap\u003c/code\u003e, or place a dummy binding the \u003ccode\u003eInputMap\u003c/code\u003e. Removing the binding from the \u003ccode\u003eInputMap\u003c/code\u003e allows bindings in parent \u003ccode\u003eInputMap\u003c/code\u003es to be active, whereas putting a dummy binding in the \u003ccode\u003eInputMap\u003c/code\u003e effectively disables the binding from ever happening. \u003cp\u003e Unregisters a keyboard action.
