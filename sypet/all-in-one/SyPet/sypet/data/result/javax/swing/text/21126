This can be used for determining which view is the most attractive to call \u003ccode\u003ebreakView\u003c/code\u003e on in the process of formatting.  The higher the weight, the more attractive the break.  A value equal to or lower than \u003ccode\u003eView.BadBreakWeight\u003c/code\u003e should not be considered for a break.  A value greater than or equal to \u003ccode\u003eView.ForcedBreakWeight\u003c/code\u003e should be broken. \u003cp\u003e This is implemented to forward to the superclass for the Y_AXIS.  Along the X_AXIS the following values may be returned. \u003cdl\u003e \u003cdt\u003e\u003cb\u003eView.ExcellentBreakWeight\u003c/b\u003e \u003cdd\u003eif there is whitespace proceeding the desired break location. \u003cdt\u003e\u003cb\u003eView.BadBreakWeight\u003c/b\u003e \u003cdd\u003eif the desired break location results in a break location of the starting offset. \u003cdt\u003e\u003cb\u003eView.GoodBreakWeight\u003c/b\u003e \u003cdd\u003eif the other conditions don\u0027t occur. \u003c/dl\u003e This will normally result in the behavior of breaking on a whitespace location if one can be found, otherwise breaking between characters.\n * @param axis may be either View.X_AXIS or View.Y_AXIS\n * @param pos the potential location of the start of thebroken view \u003e\u003d 0.
