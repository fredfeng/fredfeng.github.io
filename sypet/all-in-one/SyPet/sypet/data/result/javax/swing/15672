The number of sort keys determines how equal values are resolved when sorting.  For example, assume a table row sorter is created and \u003ccode\u003esetMaxSortKeys(2)\u003c/code\u003e is invoked on it. The user clicks the header for column 1, causing the table rows to be sorted based on the items in column 1.  Next, the user clicks the header for column 2, causing the table to be sorted based on the items in column 2; if any items in column 2 are equal, then those particular rows are ordered based on the items in column 1. In this case, we say that the rows are primarily sorted on column 2, and secondarily on column 1.  If the user then clicks the header for column 3, then the items are primarily sorted on column 3 and secondarily sorted on column 2.  Because the maximum number of sort keys has been set to 2 with \u003ccode\u003esetMaxSortKeys\u003c/code\u003e, column 1 no longer has an effect on the order. \u003cp\u003e The maximum number of sort keys is enforced by \u003ccode\u003etoggleSortOrder\u003c/code\u003e.  You can specify more sort keys by invoking \u003ccode\u003esetSortKeys\u003c/code\u003e directly and they will all be honored.  However if \u003ccode\u003etoggleSortOrder\u003c/code\u003e is subsequently invoked the maximum number of sort keys will be enforced. The default value is 3.\n * @param max the maximum number of sort keys\n * @throws IllegalArgumentException if \u003ccode\u003emax\u003c/code\u003e \u0026lt; 1\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"sort":19,"next":1,"particular":1,"click":3,"primarili":2,"specifi":1,"order":4,"toggl":2,"sorter":1,"longer":1,"valu":2,"subsequ":1,"howev":1,"key":11,"argument":1,"direct":1,"except":1,"assum":1,"max":5,"honor":1,"enforc":2,"creat":1,"invok":3,"resolv":1,"equal":2,"number":6,"illeg":1,"row":4,"header":3,"secondarili":2,"caus":2,"effect":1,"tabl":3,"maximum":5,"determin":1,"item":5,"will":2,"say":1,"exampl":1,"column":12,"base":3,"user":3},"maxFreq":19,"totalTerms":124},"loc":6}
