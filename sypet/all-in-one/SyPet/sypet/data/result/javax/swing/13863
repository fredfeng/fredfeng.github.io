This method is useful when you want to customize what you print versus what you show on the screen. \u003cp\u003e You can detect changes in the value of this property by listening for property change events on this component with name \u003ccode\u003e\"paintingForPrint\"\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e Note: This method provides complimentary functionality to that provided by other high level Swing printing APIs. However, it deals strictly with painting and should not be confused as providing information on higher level print processes. For example, a  {@link javax.swing.JTable#print()}operation doesn\u0027t necessarily result in a continuous rendering of the full component, and the return value of this method can change multiple times during that operation. It is even possible for the component to be painted to the screen while the printing process is ongoing. In such a case, the return value of this method is \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e when, and only when, the table is being painted as part of the printing process.\n * @return true if the current painting operation on this componentis part of a print operation\n * @see #print\n * @since 1.6\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"jtabl":1,"result":1,"complimentari":1,"link":1,"versus":1,"higher":1,"possibl":1,"use":1,"show":1,"function":1,"time":1,"level":2,"deal":1,"full":1,"oper":6,"javax":1,"event":1,"name":1,"current":2,"valu":3,"howev":1,"swing":2,"listen":1,"want":1,"note":1,"custom":1,"componenti":1,"screen":2,"detect":1,"multipl":1,"true":3,"paint":7,"provid":3,"continu":1,"confus":1,"print":11,"render":1,"process":3,"inform":1,"compon":4,"tabl":1,"exampl":1,"ongo":1,"even":1,"method":4,"high":1,"chang":3,"properti":2,"necessarili":1,"strict":1,"part":3},"maxFreq":11,"totalTerms":95},"loc":3}
