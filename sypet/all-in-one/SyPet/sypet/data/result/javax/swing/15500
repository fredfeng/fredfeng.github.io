The decision of lightweight versus heavyweight is ultimately up to the \u003ccode\u003eJComboBox\u003c/code\u003e.  Lightweight windows are more efficient than heavyweight windows, but lightweight and heavyweight components do not mix well in a GUI. If your application mixes lightweight and heavyweight components, you should disable lightweight popups. The default value for the \u003ccode\u003elightWeightPopupEnabled\u003c/code\u003e property is \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e, unless otherwise specified by the look and feel.  Some look and feels always use heavyweight popups, no matter what the value of this property. \u003cp\u003e See the article \u003ca href\u003d\"http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc/articles/mixing/index.html\"\u003eMixing Heavy and Light Components\u003c/a\u003e on \u003ca href\u003d\"http://java.sun.com/products/jfc/tsc\"\u003e \u003cem\u003eThe Swing Connection\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e This method fires a property changed event.\n * @param aFlag if \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e, lightweight popups are desired\n * @beaninfo bound: true expert: true description: Set to \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e to require heavyweight popups.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":1,"com":2,"heavyweight":7,"versus":2,"desir":1,"whether":1,"specifi":1,"requir":1,"event":1,"effici":1,"swing":1,"light":4,"href":2,"jfc":2,"index":1,"enabl":3,"alway":1,"descript":1,"provid":1,"flag":1,"window":3,"disabl":1,"http":2,"contain":1,"properti":4,"lightweight":7,"expert":1,"panel":1,"otherwis":1,"weight":3,"ultim":1,"connect":1,"beaninfo":1,"decis":1,"jcombo":2,"tsc":2,"use":2,"well":1,"applic":1,"sun":2,"unless":1,"popup":7,"valu":2,"heavi":1,"look":2,"feel":2,"matter":1,"true":4,"hint":1,"fire":1,"mix":4,"product":2,"compon":5,"articl":2,"method":1,"box":2,"java":2,"html":1,"chang":1,"bound":1},"maxFreq":7,"totalTerms":116},"loc":5}
