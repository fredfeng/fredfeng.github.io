If the specified indices are within the viewable set of rows, or bound the viewable set of rows, then the specified rows are constrained by the viewable set of rows. If the specified indices are not within the viewable set of rows, or do not bound the viewable set of rows, then the selection is cleared. For example, if the row count is  {@code 10}, and this method is invoked with  {@code -1, 20}, then the specified indices bounds the viewable range, and this is treated as if invoked with  {@code 0, 9}. On the other hand, if this were invoked with  {@code -10, -1}, then the specified indices do not bound the viewable set of rows, and the selection is cleared. \u003cp\u003e The parameters are not order dependent.
