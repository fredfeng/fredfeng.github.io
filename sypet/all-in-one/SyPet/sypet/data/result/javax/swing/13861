{"id":13861,"className":"javax.swing.JComponent","methodName":"print","signature":"\u003cjavax.swing.JComponent: void print(java.awt.Graphics)\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Invoke this method to print the component to the specified \u003ccode\u003eGraphics\u003c/code\u003e. This method will result in invocations of \u003ccode\u003eprintComponent\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eprintBorder\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eprintChildren\u003c/code\u003e. It is recommended that you override one of the previously mentioned methods rather than this one if your intention is to customize the way printing looks. However, it can be useful to override this method should you want to prepare state before invoking the superclass behavior. As an example, if you wanted to change the component\u0027s background color before printing, you could do the following: \u003cpre\u003e public void print(Graphics g) { Color orig \u003d getBackground(); setBackground(Color.WHITE); // wrap in try/finally so that we always restore the state try { super.print(g); } finally { setBackground(orig); } } \u003c/pre\u003e \u003cp\u003e Alternatively, or for components that delegate painting to other objects, you can query during painting whether or not the component is in the midst of a print operation. The \u003ccode\u003eisPaintingForPrint\u003c/code\u003e method provides this ability and its return value will be changed by this method: to \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e immediately before rendering and to \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e immediately after. With each change a property change event is fired on this component with the name \u003ccode\u003e\"paintingForPrint\"\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e This method sets the component\u0027s state such that the double buffer will not be used: painting will be done directly on the passed in \u003ccode\u003eGraphics\u003c/code\u003e.\n * @param g the \u003ccode\u003eGraphics\u003c/code\u003e context in which to paint\n * @see #printComponent\n * @see #printBorder\n * @see #printChildren\n * @see #isPaintingForPrint\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":1,"midst":1,"orig":2,"abil":1,"whether":1,"specifi":1,"buffer":1,"altern":1,"oper":1,"event":1,"howev":1,"border":2,"custom":1,"follow":1,"wrap":1,"invok":2,"alway":1,"done":1,"paint":7,"provid":1,"prepar":1,"invoc":1,"render":1,"queri":1,"superclass":1,"will":4,"restor":1,"properti":1,"result":1,"graphic":4,"behavior":1,"one":2,"state":3,"use":2,"way":1,"children":2,"object":1,"recommend":1,"deleg":1,"name":1,"rather":1,"immedi":2,"mention":1,"valu":1,"want":2,"direct":1,"look":1,"previous":1,"true":1,"intent":1,"fire":1,"print":16,"pass":1,"compon":8,"color":3,"pre":2,"background":4,"context":1,"exampl":1,"method":7,"chang":4},"maxFreq":16,"totalTerms":120},"loc":11}
