The given runnable will be executed in a way that allows it to safely read the model with no changes while the runnable is being executed.  The runnable itself may \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e make any mutations. \u003cp\u003e This is implemented to aquire a read lock for the duration of the runnables execution.  There may be multiple runnables executing at the same time, and all writers will be blocked while there are active rendering runnables.  If the runnable throws an exception, its lock will be safely released. There is no protection against a runnable that never exits, which will effectively leave the document locked for it\u0027s lifetime. \u003cp\u003e If the given runnable attempts to make any mutations in this implementation, a deadlock will occur.  There is no tracking of individual rendering threads to enable detecting this situation, but a subclass could incur the overhead of tracking them and throwing an error. \u003cp\u003e This method is thread safe, although most Swing methods are not.
