This will cause a DocumentEvent of type DocumentEvent.EventType.REMOVE to be sent to the registered DocumentListeners, unless an exception is thrown.  The notification will be sent to the listeners by calling the removeUpdate method on the DocumentListeners. \u003cp\u003e To ensure reasonable behavior in the face of concurrency, the event is dispatched after the mutation has occurred. This means that by the time a notification of removal is dispatched, the document has already been updated and any marks created by \u003ccode\u003ecreatePosition\u003c/code\u003e have already changed. For a removal, the end of the removal range is collapsed down to the start of the range, and any marks in the removal range are collapsed down to the start of the range. \u003cp align\u003dcenter\u003e\u003cimg src\u003d\"doc-files/Document-remove.gif\" alt\u003d\"Diagram shows removal of \u0027quick\u0027 from \u0027The quick brown fox.\u0027\"\u003e \u003cp\u003e If the Document structure changed as result of the removal, the details of what Elements were inserted and removed in response to the change will also be contained in the generated DocumentEvent.
