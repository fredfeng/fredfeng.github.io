The \u003ccode\u003eBorder\u003c/code\u003e object is responsible for defining the insets for the component (overriding any insets set directly on the component) and for optionally rendering any border decorations within the bounds of those insets.  Borders should be used (rather than insets) for creating both decorative and non-decorative (such as margins and padding) regions for a swing component. Compound borders can be used to nest multiple borders within a single component. \u003cp\u003e Although technically you can set the border on any object that inherits from \u003ccode\u003eJComponent\u003c/code\u003e, the look and feel implementation of many standard Swing components doesn\u0027t work well with user-set borders.  In general, when you want to set a border on a standard Swing component other than \u003ccode\u003eJPanel\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003eJLabel\u003c/code\u003e, we recommend that you put the component in a \u003ccode\u003eJPanel\u003c/code\u003e and set the border on the \u003ccode\u003eJPanel\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e This is a bound property.\n * @param border the border to be rendered for this component\n * @see Border\n * @see CompoundBorder\n * @beaninfo bound: true preferred: true attribute: visualUpdate true description: The component\u0027s border.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"region":1,"defin":1,"put":1,"compound":2,"beaninfo":1,"singl":1,"jlabel":1,"use":2,"jpanel":3,"well":1,"object":2,"recommend":1,"decor":3,"jcompon":1,"although":1,"attribut":1,"rather":1,"margin":1,"border":16,"swing":3,"want":1,"option":1,"work":1,"look":1,"direct":1,"mani":1,"feel":1,"pad":1,"technic":1,"standard":2,"respons":1,"multipl":1,"creat":1,"inset":4,"nest":1,"descript":1,"true":3,"general":1,"render":2,"non":1,"visual":1,"updat":1,"compon":10,"properti":1,"within":2,"prefer":1,"user":1,"bound":3},"maxFreq":16,"totalTerms":91},"loc":13}
