This can be used for determining which view is the most attractive to call \u003ccode\u003ebreakView\u003c/code\u003e on in the process of formatting.  A view that represents text that has whitespace in it might be more attractive than a view that has no whitespace, for example.  The higher the weight, the more attractive the break.  A value equal to or lower than \u003ccode\u003eBadBreakWeight\u003c/code\u003e should not be considered for a break.  A value greater than or equal to \u003ccode\u003eForcedBreakWeight\u003c/code\u003e should be broken. \u003cp\u003e This is implemented to provide the default behavior of returning \u003ccode\u003eBadBreakWeight\u003c/code\u003e unless the length is greater than the length of the view in which case the entire view represents the fragment.  Unless a view has been written to support breaking behavior, it is not attractive to try and break the view.  An example of a view that does support breaking is \u003ccode\u003eLabelView\u003c/code\u003e.
