This may be  {@code null} if the component does not supportdata transfer operations. \u003cp\u003e If the new  {@code TransferHandler} is not {@code null}, this method also installs a \u003cb\u003enew\u003c/b\u003e  {@code DropTarget} on the component toactivate drop handling through the  {@code TransferHandler} and activateany built-in support (such as calculating and displaying potential drop locations). If you do not wish for this component to respond in any way to drops, you can disable drop support entirely either by removing the drop target ( {@code setDropTarget(null)}) or by de-activating it ( {@code getDropTaget().setActive(false)}). \u003cp\u003e If the new  {@code TransferHandler} is {@code null}, this method removes the drop target. \u003cp\u003e Under two circumstances, this method does not modify the drop target: First, if the existing drop target on this component was explicitly set by the developer to a  {@code non-null} value. Second, if thesystem property  {@code suppressSwingDropSupport} is {@code true}.
