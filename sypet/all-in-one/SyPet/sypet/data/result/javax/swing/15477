{"id":15477,"className":"javax.swing.Box","methodName":"createGlue","signature":"\u003cjavax.swing.Box: java.awt.Component createGlue()\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Creates an invisible \"glue\" component that can be useful in a Box whose visible components have a maximum width (for a horizontal box) or height (for a vertical box). You can think of the glue component as being a gooey substance that expands as much as necessary to fill the space between its neighboring components. \u003cp\u003e For example, suppose you have a horizontal box that contains two fixed-size components. If the box gets extra space, the fixed-size components won\u0027t become larger, so where does the extra space go? Without glue, the extra space goes to the right of the second component. If you put glue between the fixed-size components, then the extra space goes there. If you put glue before the first fixed-size component, the extra space goes there, and the fixed-size components are shoved against the right edge of the box. If you put glue before the first fixed-size component and after the second fixed-size component, the fixed-size components are centered in the box. \u003cp\u003e To use glue, call \u003ccode\u003eBox.createGlue\u003c/code\u003e and add the returned component to a container. The glue component has no minimum or preferred size, so it takes no space unless excess space is available. If excess space is available, then the glue component takes its share of available horizontal or vertical space, just like any other component that has no maximum width or height.\n * @return the component\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"call":1,"goe":3,"put":3,"edg":1,"second":2,"minimum":1,"visibl":1,"excess":2,"glue":11,"use":2,"neighbor":1,"add":1,"space":10,"shove":1,"necessari":1,"substanc":1,"center":1,"share":1,"becom":1,"height":2,"unless":1,"fix":8,"expand":1,"horizont":3,"right":2,"just":1,"think":1,"vertic":2,"whose":1,"creat":3,"extra":5,"larger":1,"width":2,"invis":1,"gooey":1,"fill":1,"suppos":1,"avail":3,"like":1,"without":1,"much":1,"size":9,"two":1,"compon":18,"take":2,"maximum":2,"contain":2,"exampl":1,"box":8,"prefer":1,"first":2},"maxFreq":18,"totalTerms":134},"loc":4}
