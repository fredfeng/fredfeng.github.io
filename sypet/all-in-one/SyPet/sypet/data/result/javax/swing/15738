This method requires that you specify the total amount of space to be allocated, the size requirements for each component to be placed (specified as an array of SizeRequirements), and the total size requirement of the set of components. You can get the total size requirement by invoking the getTiledSizeRequirements method. This method also requires a flag indicating whether components should be tiled in the forward direction (offsets increasing from 0) or reverse direction (offsets decreasing from the end of the allocated space).  The forward direction represents components tiled from left to right or top to bottom.  The reverse direction represents components tiled from right to left or bottom to top.\n * @param allocated the total span to be allocated \u003e\u003d 0.\n * @param total     the total of the children requests.
