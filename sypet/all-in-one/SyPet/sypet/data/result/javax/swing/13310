The number that is passed in represents the distance, measured in values, between each major tick mark. If you have a slider with a range from 0 to 50 and the major tick spacing is set to 10, you will get major ticks next to the following values: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. \u003cp\u003e In order for major ticks to be painted,  {@code setPaintTicks} must beset to  {@code true}. \u003cp\u003e This method will also set up a label table for you. If there is not already a label table, and the major tick spacing is {@code \u003e 0}, and  {@code getPaintLabels} returns{@code true}, a standard label table will be generated (by calling {@code createStandardLabels}) with labels at the major tick marks. For the example above, you would get text labels: \"0\", \"10\", \"20\", \"30\", \"40\", \"50\". The label table is then set on the slider by calling {@code setLabelTable}.\n * @param n  new value for the {@code majorTickSpacing} property\n * @see #getMajorTickSpacing\n * @see #setPaintTicks\n * @see #setLabelTable\n * @see #createStandardLabels(int)\n * @beaninfo bound: true attribute: visualUpdate true description: Sets the number of values between major tick marks.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"slider":2,"call":2,"beaninfo":1,"next":1,"space":6,"must":1,"attribut":1,"order":1,"rang":1,"beset":1,"valu":4,"major":11,"follow":1,"text":1,"standard":3,"creat":2,"repres":1,"descript":1,"true":4,"mark":3,"number":2,"paint":4,"label":11,"pass":1,"tick":13,"visual":1,"updat":1,"tabl":6,"generat":1,"exampl":1,"distanc":1,"will":3,"alreadi":1,"measur":1,"method":2,"properti":1,"also":1,"bound":1},"maxFreq":13,"totalTerms":100},"loc":11}
