The resulting span allocations will overlap, with each one fitting as well as possible into the given total allocation. This method requires that you specify the total amount of space to be allocated, the size requirements for each component to be placed (specified as an array of SizeRequirements), and the total size requirements of the set of components (only the alignment field of which is actually used) You can get the total size requirement by invoking getAlignedSizeRequirements. This method also requires a flag indicating whether normal or reverse alignment should be performed.  With normal alignment the value 0.0f represents the left/top edge of the component to be aligned.  With reverse alignment, 0.0f represents the right/bottom edge.\n * @param allocated the total span to be allocated \u003e\u003d 0.\n * @param total     the total of the children requests.\n * @param children  the size requirements for each component.\n * @param offsets   the offset from 0 for each child wherethe spans were allocated (determines placement of the span).\n * @param spans     the span allocated for each child to make thetotal target span.\n * @param normal    when true, the alignment value 0.0f meansleft/top; when false, it means right/bottom.\n * @since 1.4\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":1,"total":7,"normal":3,"possibl":1,"perform":1,"whether":1,"specifi":4,"amount":1,"whereth":1,"requir":8,"given":1,"request":1,"place":1,"right":2,"overlap":1,"creat":1,"invok":1,"calcul":1,"align":9,"meansleft":1,"size":6,"flag":1,"determin":1,"will":1,"bottom":2,"make":1,"posit":1,"span":8,"alloc":7,"array":1,"placement":1,"result":1,"edg":2,"pair":1,"one":1,"use":1,"children":2,"well":1,"space":1,"child":2,"fit":1,"revers":2,"indic":1,"mean":1,"valu":2,"left":1,"offset":3,"top":2,"repres":2,"lay":1,"true":1,"field":1,"compon":5,"target":1,"thetot":1,"actual":1,"method":2,"also":1},"maxFreq":9,"totalTerms":118},"loc":16}
