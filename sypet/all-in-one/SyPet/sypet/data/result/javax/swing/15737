This method requires that you specify the total amount of space to be allocated, the size requirements for each component to be placed (specified as an array of SizeRequirements), and the total size requirement of the set of components. You can get the total size requirement by invoking the getTiledSizeRequirements method.  The components will be tiled in the forward direction with offsets increasing from 0.\n * @param allocated the total span to be allocated \u003e\u003d 0.\n * @param total     the total of the children requests.  This argumentis optional and may be null.\n * @param children  the size requirements for each component.\n * @param offsets   the offset from 0 for each child wherethe spans were allocated (determines placement of the span).\n * @param spans     the span allocated for each child to make thetotal target span.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"placement":1,"increas":1,"total":6,"pair":1,"children":2,"space":1,"specifi":2,"child":2,"amount":1,"whereth":1,"requir":7,"forward":1,"request":1,"offset":4,"place":1,"option":1,"end":2,"direct":1,"may":1,"repres":1,"creat":1,"lay":1,"invok":1,"calcul":1,"argumenti":1,"size":6,"compon":5,"determin":1,"tile":3,"target":1,"thetot":1,"will":1,"method":2,"make":1,"posit":1,"span":7,"alloc":5,"array":1},"maxFreq":7,"totalTerms":78},"loc":3}
