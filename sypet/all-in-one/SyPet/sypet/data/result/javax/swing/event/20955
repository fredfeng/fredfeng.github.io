Note that for performance reasons, this implementation passes back the actual data structure in which the listener data is stored internally! This method is guaranteed to pass back a non-null array, so that no null-checking is required in fire methods.  A zero-length array of Object should be returned if there are currently no listeners. WARNING!!! Absolutely NO modification of the data contained in this array should be made -- if any such manipulation is necessary, it should be done on a copy of the array returned rather than the array itself.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"manipul":1,"store":1,"reason":1,"pair":1,"structur":1,"made":1,"data":3,"perform":1,"object":1,"type":1,"zero":1,"necessari":1,"copi":1,"requir":1,"event":1,"current":1,"length":1,"rather":1,"listen":6,"note":1,"check":1,"guarante":1,"done":1,"back":3,"list":2,"absolut":1,"fire":1,"pass":3,"non":1,"contain":1,"intern":1,"actual":1,"method":2,"modif":1,"array":6},"maxFreq":6,"totalTerms":53},"loc":3}
