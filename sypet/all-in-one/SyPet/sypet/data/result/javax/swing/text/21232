The returned  {@code Printable} printsthe document as it looks on the screen except being reformatted to fit the paper. The returned  {@code Printable} can be wrapped inside another{@code Printable} in order to create complex reports anddocuments. \u003cp\u003e The returned  {@code Printable} shares the {@code document} with this{@code JTextComponent}. It is the responsibility of the developer to ensure that the  {@code document} is not mutated while this {@code Printable}is used. Printing behavior is undefined when the  {@code document} ismutated during printing. \u003cp\u003e Page header and footer text can be added to the output by providing {@code MessageFormat} arguments. The printing code requests{@code Strings} from the formats, providing a single item which may beincluded in the formatted string: an  {@code Integer} representing thecurrent page number. \u003cp\u003e The returned  {@code Printable} when printed, formats thedocument content appropriately for the page size. For correct line wrapping the  {@code imageable width} of all pages must be thesame.
