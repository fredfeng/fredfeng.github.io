{"id":14844,"className":"javax.swing.JTable","methodName":"print","signature":"\u003cjavax.swing.JTable: boolean print(javax.swing.PrintMode,java.text.MessageFormat,java.text.MessageFormat,boolean,javax.print.attribute.PrintRequestAttributeSet,boolean,javax.print.PrintService)\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Prints this \u003ccode\u003eJTable\u003c/code\u003e. Takes steps that the majority of developers would take in order to print a \u003ccode\u003eJTable\u003c/code\u003e. In short, it prepares the table, calls \u003ccode\u003egetPrintable\u003c/code\u003e to fetch an appropriate \u003ccode\u003ePrintable\u003c/code\u003e, and then sends it to the printer. \u003cp\u003e A \u003ccode\u003eboolean\u003c/code\u003e parameter allows you to specify whether or not a printing dialog is displayed to the user. When it is, the user may use the dialog to change the destination printer or printing attributes, or even to cancel the print. Another two parameters allow for a \u003ccode\u003ePrintService\u003c/code\u003e and printing attributes to be specified. These parameters can be used either to provide initial values for the print dialog, or to specify values when the dialog is not shown. \u003cp\u003e A second \u003ccode\u003eboolean\u003c/code\u003e parameter allows you to specify whether or not to perform printing in an interactive mode. If \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e, a modal progress dialog, with an abort option, is displayed for the duration of printing . This dialog also prevents any user action which may affect the table. However, it can not prevent the table from being modified by code (for example, another thread that posts updates using \u003ccode\u003eSwingUtilities.invokeLater\u003c/code\u003e). It is therefore the responsibility of the developer to ensure that no other code modifies the table in any way during printing (invalid modifications include changes in: size, renderers, or underlying data). Printing behavior is undefined when the table is changed during printing. \u003cp\u003e If \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e is specified for this parameter, no dialog will be displayed and printing will begin immediately on the event-dispatch thread. This blocks any other events, including repaints, from being processed until printing is complete. Although this effectively prevents the table from being changed, it doesn\u0027t provide a good user experience. For this reason, specifying \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e is only recommended when printing from an application with no visible GUI. \u003cp\u003e Note: Attempting to show the printing dialog or run interactively, while in headless mode, will result in a \u003ccode\u003eHeadlessException\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e Before fetching the printable, this method will gracefully terminate editing, if necessary, to prevent an editor from showing in the printed result. Additionally, \u003ccode\u003eJTable\u003c/code\u003e will prepare its renderers during printing such that selection and focus are not indicated. As far as customizing further how the table looks in the printout, developers can provide custom renderers or paint code that conditionalize on the value of  {@link javax.swing.JComponent#isPaintingForPrint()}. \u003cp\u003e See  {@link #getPrintable} for more description on how the table isprinted.\n * @param printMode        the printing mode that the printable should use\n * @param headerFormat     a \u003ccode\u003eMessageFormat\u003c/code\u003e specifying the textto be used in printing a header, or \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e for none\n * @param footerFormat     a \u003ccode\u003eMessageFormat\u003c/code\u003e specifying the textto be used in printing a footer, or \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e for none\n * @param showPrintDialog  whether or not to display a print dialog\n * @param attr             a \u003ccode\u003ePrintRequestAttributeSet\u003c/code\u003especifying any printing attributes, or \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e for none\n * @param interactive      whether or not to print in an interactive mode\n * @param service          the destination \u003ccode\u003ePrintService\u003c/code\u003e,or \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e to use the default printer\n * @return true, unless printing is cancelled by the user\n * @throws HeadlessException if the method is asked to show a printingdialog or run interactively, and \u003ccode\u003eGraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless\u003c/code\u003e returns \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e\n * @throws SecurityException if a security manager exists and its{@link java.lang.SecurityManager#checkPrintJobAccess}method disallows this thread from creating a print job request\n * @throws PrinterException if an error in the print system causes the jobto be aborted\n * @see #getPrintable\n * @see java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment#isHeadless\n * @since 1.6\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"reason":1,"servic":3,"whether":4,"specifi":9,"disallow":1,"jcompon":1,"although":1,"event":2,"thread":3,"focus":1,"isprint":1,"undefin":1,"option":1,"fetch":2,"respons":1,"invok":1,"job":2,"shown":1,"attr":1,"prevent":4,"provid":3,"header":2,"prepar":2,"grace":1,"system":1,"editor":1,"will":5,"ask":1,"graphic":2,"behavior":1,"visibl":1,"link":3,"data":1,"printingdialog":1,"use":7,"block":1,"anoth":2,"therefor":1,"run":2,"applic":1,"mode":5,"ensur":1,"durat":1,"attribut":4,"unless":1,"indic":1,"initi":1,"modal":1,"note":1,"complet":1,"look":1,"addit":1,"may":2,"post":1,"messag":2,"later":1,"true":3,"access":1,"printer":4,"footer":2,"process":1,"either":1,"tabl":8,"appropri":1,"experi":1,"exampl":1,"method":3,"interact":5,"jobto":1,"modif":1,"abort":2,"destin":2,"progress":1,"fals":2,"send":1,"second":1,"perform":1,"cancel":2,"good":1,"show":4,"necessari":1,"invalid":1,"javax":1,"request":2,"action":1,"none":3,"howev":1,"swing":2,"custom":2,"except":4,"creat":1,"condition":1,"select":1,"environ":2,"descript":1,"far":1,"paint":2,"display":4,"format":4,"headless":5,"size":1,"render":3,"awt":1,"updat":1,"repaint":1,"even":1,"util":1,"jtabl":3,"attempt":1,"result":2,"call":1,"allow":3,"way":1,"lang":1,"affect":1,"recommend":1,"printout":1,"order":1,"valu":3,"immedi":1,"dispatch":1,"develop":3,"dialog":10,"exist":1,"major":1,"includ":2,"error":1,"check":1,"manag":2,"edit":1,"paramet":5,"textto":2,"printabl":6,"print":35,"begin":1,"two":1,"termin":1,"caus":1,"secur":3,"effect":1,"take":2,"modifi":2,"java":2,"chang":4,"also":1,"user":5,"step":1},"maxFreq":35,"totalTerms":320},"loc":130}
