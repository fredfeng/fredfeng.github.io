The preferred size for \u003ccode\u003eJEditorPane\u003c/code\u003e is slightly altered from the preferred size of the superclass.  If the size of the viewport has become smaller than the minimum size of the component, the scrollable definition for tracking width or height will turn to false.  The default viewport layout will give the preferred size, and that is not desired in the case where the scrollable is tracking.  In that case the \u003cem\u003enormal\u003c/em\u003e preferred size is adjusted to the minimum size.  This allows things like HTML tables to shrink down to their minimum size and then be laid out at their minimum size, refusing to shrink any further.\n * @return a \u003ccode\u003eDimension\u003c/code\u003e containing the preferred size\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":1,"scrollabl":2,"allow":1,"minimum":4,"give":1,"normal":1,"desir":1,"refus":1,"smaller":1,"becom":1,"slight":1,"height":1,"layout":1,"adjust":1,"viewport":2,"turn":1,"width":1,"track":2,"dimens":1,"like":1,"alter":1,"pane":2,"size":12,"superclass":1,"compon":1,"tabl":1,"contain":1,"definit":1,"will":2,"laid":1,"shrink":2,"jeditor":2,"prefer":7,"thing":1},"maxFreq":12,"totalTerms":61},"loc":30}
