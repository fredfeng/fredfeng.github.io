{"id":17389,"className":"javax.swing.undo.UndoableEdit","methodName":"addEdit","signature":"\u003cjavax.swing.undo.UndoableEdit: boolean addEdit(javax.swing.undo.UndoableEdit)\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Adds an \u003ccode\u003eUndoableEdit\u003c/code\u003e to this \u003ccode\u003eUndoableEdit\u003c/code\u003e. This method can be used to coalesce smaller edits into a larger compound edit.  For example, text editors typically allow undo operations to apply to words or sentences.  The text editor may choose to generate edits on each key event, but allow those edits to be coalesced into a more user-friendly unit, such as a word. In this case, the \u003ccode\u003eUndoableEdit\u003c/code\u003e would override \u003ccode\u003eaddEdit\u003c/code\u003e to return true when the edits may be coalesced. \u003cp\u003e A return value of true indicates \u003ccode\u003eanEdit\u003c/code\u003e was incorporated into this edit.  A return value of false indicates \u003ccode\u003eanEdit\u003c/code\u003e may not be incorporated into this edit. \u003cp\u003eTypically the receiver is already in the queue of a \u003ccode\u003eUndoManager\u003c/code\u003e (or other \u003ccode\u003eUndoableEditListener\u003c/code\u003e), and is being given a chance to incorporate \u003ccode\u003eanEdit\u003c/code\u003e rather than letting it be added to the queue in turn.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003eIf true is returned, from now on \u003ccode\u003eanEdit\u003c/code\u003e must return false from \u003ccode\u003ecanUndo\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ecanRedo\u003c/code\u003e, and must throw the appropriate exception on \u003ccode\u003eundo\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003eredo\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n * @param anEdit the edit to be added\n * @return true if \u003ccode\u003eanEdit\u003c/code\u003e may be incorporated into thisedit\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":2,"queue":2,"compound":1,"allow":2,"undo":4,"incorpor":4,"undoabl":4,"typic":2,"use":1,"add":3,"must":2,"smaller":1,"given":1,"indic":2,"oper":1,"event":1,"rather":1,"choos":1,"valu":2,"listen":1,"key":1,"turn":1,"except":1,"text":2,"may":4,"manag":1,"thisedit":1,"larger":1,"edit":20,"true":4,"receiv":1,"unit":1,"editor":2,"coalesc":3,"appli":1,"now":1,"appropri":1,"sentenc":1,"redo":2,"generat":1,"exampl":1,"ad":2,"alreadi":1,"method":1,"word":2,"user":1,"friend":1,"chanc":1},"maxFreq":20,"totalTerms":98},"loc":0}
