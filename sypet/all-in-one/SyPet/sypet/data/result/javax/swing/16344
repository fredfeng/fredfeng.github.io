{"id":16344,"className":"javax.swing.SwingUtilities","methodName":"invokeLater","signature":"\u003cjavax.swing.SwingUtilities: void invokeLater(java.lang.Runnable)\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Causes \u003ci\u003edoRun.run()\u003c/i\u003e to be executed asynchronously on the AWT event dispatching thread.  This will happen after all pending AWT events have been processed.  This method should be used when an application thread needs to update the GUI. In the following example the \u003ccode\u003einvokeLater\u003c/code\u003e call queues the \u003ccode\u003eRunnable\u003c/code\u003e object \u003ccode\u003edoHelloWorld\u003c/code\u003e on the event dispatching thread and then prints a message. \u003cpre\u003e Runnable doHelloWorld \u003d new Runnable() { public void run() { System.out.println(\"Hello World on \" + Thread.currentThread()); } }; SwingUtilities.invokeLater(doHelloWorld); System.out.println(\"This might well be displayed before the other message.\"); \u003c/pre\u003e If invokeLater is called from the event dispatching thread -- for example, from a JButton\u0027s ActionListener -- the \u003ci\u003edoRun.run()\u003c/i\u003e will still be deferred until all pending events have been processed. Note that if the \u003ci\u003edoRun.run()\u003c/i\u003e throws an uncaught exception the event dispatching thread will unwind (not the current thread). \u003cp\u003e Additional documentation and examples for this method can be found in \u003cA HREF\u003d\"http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/misc/threads.html\"\u003eHow to Use Threads\u003c/a\u003e, in \u003cem\u003eThe Java Tutorial\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cp\u003e As of 1.3 this method is just a cover for \u003ccode\u003ejava.awt.EventQueue.invokeLater()\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e Unlike the rest of Swing, this method can be invoked from any thread.\n * @see #invokeAndWait\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"unwind":1,"queue":2,"com":1,"wait":1,"tutori":2,"cover":1,"println":2,"event":7,"thread":11,"action":1,"happen":1,"swing":2,"follow":1,"except":1,"invok":7,"display":1,"awt":1,"system":2,"updat":1,"http":1,"will":3,"rest":1,"execut":1,"util":1,"call":2,"asynchron":1,"might":1,"use":2,"object":1,"well":1,"run":7,"sun":1,"applic":1,"defer":1,"jbutton":1,"document":1,"uisw":1,"unlik":1,"current":2,"dispatch":4,"runnabl":3,"listen":1,"note":1,"pend":2,"just":1,"addit":1,"later":5,"messag":2,"still":1,"uncaught":1,"print":1,"misc":1,"process":2,"hello":4,"caus":1,"pre":2,"book":1,"exampl":3,"html":1,"java":3,"method":4,"world":4,"found":1},"maxFreq":11,"totalTerms":128},"loc":3}
