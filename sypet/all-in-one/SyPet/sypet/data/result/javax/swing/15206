After the initial mouse press occurs (and action event generated) any subsequent mouse press events which occur on intervals less than the threshhold will be ignored and no corresponding action event generated.  By default the threshhold is 0, which means that for each mouse press, an action event will be fired, no matter how quickly the mouse clicks occur.  In buttons where this behavior is not desirable (for example, the \"OK\" button in a dialog), this threshhold should be set to an appropriate positive value.\n * @see #getMultiClickThreshhold\n * @param threshhold the amount of time required between mousepress events to generate corresponding action events\n * @exception IllegalArgumentException if threshhold \u003c 0\n * @since 1.4\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"press":4,"behavior":1,"correspond":3,"quick":1,"click":3,"desir":1,"mous":5,"amount":2,"time":2,"requir":2,"button":3,"event":8,"millisecond":1,"action":5,"mean":1,"mousepress":1,"valu":1,"initi":1,"dialog":1,"subsequ":1,"less":1,"argument":1,"except":2,"ignor":1,"matter":1,"illeg":1,"fire":1,"interv":1,"appropri":1,"generat":4,"exampl":1,"multi":2,"will":2,"threshhold":7,"posit":1,"occur":3},"maxFreq":8,"totalTerms":77},"loc":6}
