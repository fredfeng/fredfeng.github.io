By default, when a look and feel displays a popup, it can choose to use a lightweight (all-Java) popup. Lightweight popup windows are more efficient than heavyweight (native peer) windows, but lightweight and heavyweight components do not mix well in a GUI. If your application mixes lightweight and heavyweight components, you should disable lightweight popups.
