In order to enable automatic drag handling, this property should be set to  {@code true}, and the component\u0027s  {@code TransferHandler} needs to be {@code non-null}. The default value of the  {@code dragEnabled} property is {@code false}. \u003cp\u003e The job of honoring this property, and recognizing a user drag gesture, lies with the look and feel implementation, and in particular, the component\u0027s {@code TextUI}. When automatic drag handling is enabled, most look and feels (including those that subclass  {@code BasicLookAndFeel}) begin a drag and drop operation whenever the user presses the mouse button over a selection and then moves the mouse a few pixels. Setting this property to {@code true} can therefore have a subtle effect on how selections behave.\u003cp\u003e If a look and feel is used that ignores this property, you can still begin a drag and drop operation by calling  {@code exportAsDrag} on thecomponent\u0027s  {@code TransferHandler}.\n * @param b whether or not to enable automatic drag handling\n * @exception HeadlessException if\u003ccode\u003eb\u003c/code\u003e is \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eGraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()\u003c/code\u003e returns \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e\n * @see java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment#isHeadless\n * @see #getDragEnabled\n * @see #setTransferHandler\n * @see TransferHandler\n * @since 1.4\n * @beaninfo description: determines whether automatic drag handling is enabled bound: false\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":2,"need":1,"drop":2,"behav":1,"particular":1,"subtl":1,"whether":2,"mous":2,"basic":1,"oper":2,"button":1,"recogn":1,"move":1,"turn":1,"except":2,"transfer":4,"text":1,"ignor":1,"honor":1,"enabl":7,"select":2,"descript":1,"environ":2,"job":1,"headless":3,"non":1,"awt":1,"determin":1,"subclass":1,"properti":5,"call":1,"graphic":2,"press":1,"beaninfo":1,"pixel":1,"use":1,"therefor":1,"automat":5,"order":1,"valu":1,"gestur":1,"thecompon":1,"look":4,"feel":4,"whenev":1,"export":1,"includ":1,"drag":12,"true":4,"still":1,"handl":5,"begin":2,"compon":2,"effect":1,"java":1,"user":2,"bound":1,"lie":1,"handler":4},"maxFreq":12,"totalTerms":117},"loc":6}
