The role of the object is the generic purpose or use of the class of this object.  For example, the role of a push button is AccessibleRole.PUSH_BUTTON.  The roles in AccessibleRole are provided so component developers can pick from a set of predefined roles.  This enables assistive technologies to provide a consistent interface to various tweaked subclasses of components (e.g., use AccessibleRole.PUSH_BUTTON for all components that act like a push button) as well as distinguish between sublasses that behave differently (e.g., AccessibleRole.CHECK_BOX for check boxes and AccessibleRole.RADIO_BUTTON for radio buttons). \u003cp\u003eNote that the AccessibleRole class is also extensible, so custom component developers can define their own AccessibleRole\u0027s if the set of predefined roles is inadequate.\n * @return an instance of AccessibleRole describing the role of the object\n * @see AccessibleRole\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"generic":1,"defin":1,"behav":1,"predefin":2,"use":2,"object":4,"well":1,"push":2,"button":3,"extens":1,"purpos":1,"role":17,"inadequ":1,"pick":1,"various":1,"develop":2,"note":1,"custom":1,"check":1,"consist":1,"enabl":1,"describ":1,"assist":1,"access":10,"like":1,"provid":2,"technolog":1,"instanc":1,"differ":1,"compon":4,"exampl":1,"subclass":1,"radio":1,"distinguish":1,"box":1,"tweak":1,"sublass":1,"act":1,"also":1},"maxFreq":17,"totalTerms":77},"loc":3}
