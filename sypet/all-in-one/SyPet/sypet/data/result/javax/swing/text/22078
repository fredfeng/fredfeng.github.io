This is called by views that try to do formatting of their children.  For example, a view of a paragraph will typically try to place its children into row and views representing chunks of text can sometimes be broken down into smaller pieces. \u003cp\u003e This is implemented to return the view itself, which represents the default behavior on not being breakable.  If the view does support breaking, the starting offset of the view returned should be the given offset, and the end offset should be less than or equal to the end offset of the view being broken.\n * @param axis may be either \u003ccode\u003eView.X_AXIS\u003c/code\u003e or\u003ccode\u003eView.Y_AXIS\u003c/code\u003e\n * @param offset the location in the document modelthat a broken fragment would occupy \u003e\u003d 0.
