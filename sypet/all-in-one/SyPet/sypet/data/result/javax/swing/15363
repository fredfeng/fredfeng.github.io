The default button is the button which will be activated when a UI-defined activation event (typically the \u003cb\u003eEnter\u003c/b\u003e key) occurs in the root pane regardless of whether or not the button has keyboard focus (unless there is another component within the root pane which consumes the activation event, such as a \u003ccode\u003eJTextPane\u003c/code\u003e). For default activation to work, the button must be an enabled descendent of the root pane when activation occurs. To remove a default button from this root pane, set this property to \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e.\n * @see JButton#isDefaultButton\n * @param defaultButton the \u003ccode\u003eJButton\u003c/code\u003e which is to be the default button\n * @beaninfo description: The button activated by default in this root pane\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"defin":1,"beaninfo":1,"root":5,"typic":1,"anoth":1,"activ":6,"must":1,"whether":1,"consum":1,"jbutton":2,"unless":1,"button":12,"event":2,"current":1,"focus":1,"key":1,"regardless":1,"work":1,"keyboard":1,"enabl":1,"descript":1,"remov":1,"enter":1,"pane":7,"jroot":1,"jtext":1,"compon":1,"determin":1,"will":1,"descend":1,"properti":2,"within":1,"occur":2},"maxFreq":12,"totalTerms":63},"loc":16}
