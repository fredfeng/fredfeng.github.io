The contents of the reader will be read and sent to the database. This method throws an \u003ccode\u003eSQLException\u003c/code\u003e if the number of bytes read and sent to the database is not equal to \u003ci\u003elength\u003c/i\u003e. \u003cP\u003e When a very large Unicode value is input to a \u003ccode\u003eLONGVARCHAR\u003c/code\u003e parameter, it may be more practical to send it via a \u003ccode\u003eReader\u003c/code\u003e object. A JDBC technology-enabled driver will read the data from the stream as needed until it reaches end-of-file. The driver will do any necessary conversion from Unicode to the database \u003ccode\u003eCHAR\u003c/code\u003e format. The byte format of the Unicode stream must be Java UTF-8, as defined in the Java Virtual Machine Specification. \u003cP\u003e\u003cB\u003eNote:\u003c/B\u003e This stream object can be either a standard Java stream object or your own subclass that implements the standard interface. \u003cP\u003e The parameter value set by this method is stored internally and will be supplied as the appropriate parameter in this \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object\u0027s command when the method \u003ccode\u003eexecute\u003c/code\u003e is called. Methods such as \u003ccode\u003eexecute\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003epopulate\u003c/code\u003e must be provided in any class that extends this class and implements one or more of the standard JSR-114 \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e interfaces. \u003cP\u003e NOTE: \u003ccode\u003eJdbcRowSet\u003c/code\u003e does not require the \u003ccode\u003epopulate\u003c/code\u003e method as it is undefined in this class. \u003cP\u003e Calls made to the method \u003ccode\u003egetParams\u003c/code\u003e after \u003ccode\u003esetCharacterStream\u003c/code\u003e has been called will return an array containing the parameter values that have been set.  In that array, the element that represents the values set with this method will itself be an array. The first element of that array is the given \u003ccode\u003ejava.io.Reader\u003c/code\u003e object. The second element is the value set for \u003ci\u003elength\u003c/i\u003e. The parameter number is indicated by an element\u0027s position in the array returned by the method \u003ccode\u003egetParams\u003c/code\u003e, with the first element being the value for the first placeholder parameter, the second element being the value for the second placeholder parameter, and so on. In other words, if the reader being set is the value for the second placeholder parameter, the array containing it will be the second element in the array returned by \u003ccode\u003egetParams\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cP\u003e Note that because the numbering of elements in an array starts at zero, the array element that corresponds to placeholder parameter number \u003ci\u003eparameterIndex\u003c/i\u003e is element number \u003ci\u003eparameterIndex\u003c/i\u003e -1.\n * @param parameterIndex the ordinal number of the placeholder parameterin this \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object\u0027s command that is to be set.
