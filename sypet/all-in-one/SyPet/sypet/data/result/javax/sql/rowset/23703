This method allows the \u003ccode\u003eSyncProvider\u003c/code\u003e object to be reset. \u003cP\u003e A \u003ccode\u003eCachedRowSet\u003c/code\u003e implementation should always be instantiated with an available \u003ccode\u003eSyncProvider\u003c/code\u003e mechanism, but there are cases where resetting the \u003ccode\u003eSyncProvider\u003c/code\u003e object is desirable or necessary. For example, an application might want to use the default \u003ccode\u003eSyncProvider\u003c/code\u003e object for a time and then choose to use a provider that has more recently become available and better fits its needs. \u003cP\u003e Resetting the \u003ccode\u003eSyncProvider\u003c/code\u003e object causes the \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object to request a new \u003ccode\u003eSyncProvider\u003c/code\u003e implementation from the \u003ccode\u003eSyncFactory\u003c/code\u003e. This has the effect of resetting all previous connections and relationships with the originating data source and can potentially drastically change the synchronization behavior of a disconnected rowset.\n * @param provider a \u003ccode\u003eString\u003c/code\u003e object giving the fully qualified classname of a \u003ccode\u003eSyncProvider\u003c/code\u003e implementation\n * @throws SQLException if an error occurs while attempting to reset the\u003ccode\u003eSyncProvider\u003c/code\u003e implementation\n * @see #getSyncProvider\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"instanti":1,"lexcept":1,"desir":1,"necessari":1,"specifi":1,"time":1,"becom":1,"request":1,"reset":5,"alway":1,"rowset":1,"avail":2,"provid":13,"row":3,"better":1,"classnam":1,"sourc":1,"drastic":1,"attempt":1,"might":1,"objec":1,"allow":1,"connect":1,"give":1,"behavior":1,"one":1,"data":1,"use":2,"object":7,"recent":1,"applic":1,"fit":1,"sync":12,"factori":1,"choos":1,"want":1,"error":1,"previous":1,"origin":1,"fulli":1,"cach":2,"potenti":1,"relationship":1,"caus":1,"effect":1,"mechan":1,"string":1,"exampl":1,"method":1,"disconnect":1,"chang":1,"qualifi":1,"occur":1},"maxFreq":13,"totalTerms":92},"loc":0}
