The Url property is a JDBC URL that is used when the connection is created using a JDBC technology-enabled driver (\"JDBC driver\") and the \u003ccode\u003eDriverManager\u003c/code\u003e. The correct JDBC URL for the specific driver to be used can be found in the driver documentation.  Although there are guidelines for for how a JDBC URL is formed, a driver vendor can specify any \u003ccode\u003eString\u003c/code\u003e object except one with a length of \u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e (an empty string). \u003cP\u003e Setting the Url property is optional if connections are established using a \u003ccode\u003eDataSource\u003c/code\u003e object instead of the \u003ccode\u003eDriverManager\u003c/code\u003e. The driver will use either the URL property or the dataSourceName property to create a connection, whichever was specified most recently. If an application uses a JDBC URL, it must load a JDBC driver that accepts the JDBC URL before it uses the \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object to connect to a database.  The \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object will use the URL internally to create a database connection in order to read or write data.\n * @param url a \u003ccode\u003eString\u003c/code\u003e object that contains the JDBC URLthat will be used to establish the connection to a database for this \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object; may be \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e but must not be an empty string\n * @throws SQLException if an error occurs setting the Url property or theparameter supplied is a string with a length of \u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e (an empty string)\n * @see #getUrl\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"accept":1,"lexcept":1,"must":2,"specifi":2,"whichev":1,"although":1,"correct":1,"given":1,"option":1,"except":1,"form":1,"creat":3,"enabl":1,"url":7,"row":4,"databas":3,"contain":1,"will":3,"sourc":3,"load":1,"properti":7,"guidelin":1,"connect":6,"one":1,"data":4,"use":9,"theparamet":1,"object":8,"recent":1,"applic":1,"document":1,"order":1,"name":2,"length":2,"write":1,"read":1,"driver":9,"may":1,"error":1,"vendor":1,"manag":2,"establish":2,"lthat":1,"suppli":1,"technolog":1,"empti":3,"specif":1,"either":1,"string":7,"instead":1,"intern":1,"occur":1,"found":1},"maxFreq":9,"totalTerms":121},"loc":13}
