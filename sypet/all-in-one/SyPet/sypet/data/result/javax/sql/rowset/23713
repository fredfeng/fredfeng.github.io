{"id":23713,"className":"javax.sql.rowset.CachedRowSet","methodName":"createShared","signature":"\u003cjavax.sql.rowset.CachedRowSet: javax.sql.RowSet createShared()\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Returns a new \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object backed by the same data as that of this \u003ccode\u003eCachedRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object. In effect, both \u003ccode\u003eCachedRowSet\u003c/code\u003e objects have a cursor over the same data. As a result, any changes made by a duplicate are visible to the original and to any other duplicates, just as a change made by the original is visible to all of its duplicates. If a duplicate calls a method that changes the underlying data, the method it calls notifies all registered listeners just as it would when it is called by the original \u003ccode\u003eCachedRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object. \u003cP\u003e In addition, any \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object created by this method will have the same properties as this \u003ccode\u003eCachedRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object. For example, if this \u003ccode\u003eCachedRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object is read-only, all of its duplicates will also be read-only. If it is changed to be updatable, the duplicates also become updatable. \u003cP\u003e NOTE: If multiple threads access \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e objects created from the \u003ccode\u003ecreateShared()\u003c/code\u003e method, the following behavior is specified to preserve shared data integrity: reads and writes of all shared \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e objects should be made serially between each object and the single underlying tabular structure.\n * @return a new shared \u003ccode\u003eRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object that has the same propertiesas this \u003ccode\u003eCachedRowSet\u003c/code\u003e object and that has a cursor over the same data\n * @throws SQLException if an error occurs or cloning is notsupported in the underlying platform\n * @see javax.sql.RowSetEvent\n * @see javax.sql.RowSetListener\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"cursor":2,"integr":1,"singl":1,"lexcept":1,"specifi":1,"becom":1,"event":1,"javax":2,"thread":1,"follow":1,"notifi":1,"platform":1,"clone":1,"multipl":1,"creat":4,"preserv":1,"row":13,"updat":2,"will":2,"duplic":6,"properti":1,"call":3,"result":1,"structur":1,"visibl":2,"behavior":1,"data":5,"made":3,"propertiesa":1,"object":12,"tabular":1,"share":5,"write":1,"regist":1,"read":3,"listen":2,"just":2,"addit":1,"error":1,"origin":3,"back":1,"cach":6,"access":1,"notsupport":1,"sql":2,"effect":1,"exampl":1,"method":4,"chang":4,"also":2,"serial":1,"occur":1},"maxFreq":13,"totalTerms":119},"loc":0}
