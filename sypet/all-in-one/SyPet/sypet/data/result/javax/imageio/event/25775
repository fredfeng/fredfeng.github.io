The percentage should ideally be calculated in terms of the remaining time to completion, but it is usually more practical to use a more well-defined metric such as pixels decoded or portion of input stream consumed.  In any case, a sequence of calls to this method during a given read operation should supply a monotonically increasing sequence of percentage values.  It is not necessary to supply the exact values \u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e100\u003c/code\u003e, as these may be inferred by the callee from other methods. \u003cp\u003e Each particular \u003ccode\u003eImageWriter\u003c/code\u003e implementation may call this method at whatever frequency it desires.
