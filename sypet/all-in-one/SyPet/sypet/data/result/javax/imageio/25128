Rather than re-scanning the classpath on every invocation of the API, the class path is scanned automatically only on the first invocation. Clients can call this method to prompt a re-scan. Thus this method need only be invoked by sophisticated applications which dynamically make new plug-ins available at runtime. \u003cp\u003e The \u003ccode\u003egetResources\u003c/code\u003e method of the context \u003ccode\u003eClassLoader\u003c/code\u003e is used locate JAR files containing files named \u003ccode\u003eMETA-INF/services/javax.imageio.spi.\u003c/code\u003e\u003ci\u003eclassname\u003c/i\u003e, where \u003ci\u003eclassname\u003c/i\u003e is one of \u003ccode\u003eImageReaderSpi\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eImageWriterSpi\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eImageTranscoderSpi\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eImageInputStreamSpi\u003c/code\u003e, or \u003ccode\u003eImageOutputStreamSpi\u003c/code\u003e, along the application class path. \u003cp\u003e The contents of the located files indicate the names of actual implementation classes which implement the aforementioned service provider interfaces; the default class loader is then used to load each of these classes and to instantiate an instance of each class, which is then placed into the registry for later retrieval. \u003cp\u003e The exact set of locations searched depends on the implementation of the Java runtime enviroment.\n * @see ClassLoader#getResources\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":2,"client":1,"instanti":1,"servic":4,"plugin":1,"transcod":1,"becom":1,"search":1,"oregistri":1,"file":3,"javax":1,"exact":1,"spi":6,"along":1,"place":1,"writer":1,"everi":1,"imageio":1,"dynam":1,"invok":1,"loader":3,"runtim":2,"enviro":1,"registri":1,"avail":2,"imag":5,"provid":3,"classpath":1,"invoc":2,"instanc":2,"content":1,"input":1,"reader":1,"plug":3,"contain":1,"load":2,"classnam":2,"output":1,"make":1,"call":1,"stream":2,"one":2,"use":2,"aforement":1,"automat":1,"applic":4,"sophist":1,"resourc":2,"indic":1,"name":2,"path":4,"rather":1,"regist":1,"theoret":1,"addit":1,"may":1,"locat":3,"thus":1,"depend":1,"later":1,"retriev":1,"context":1,"actual":1,"java":1,"method":4,"scan":5,"chang":1,"prompt":1,"first":1,"found":1},"maxFreq":6,"totalTerms":117},"loc":3}
