However, for several reasons it is necessary to associate a list of types with each service provider.  First, many common image file formats do not have standard MIME types, so a list of commonly used unofficial names will be required, such as \u003ccode\u003eimage/x-pbm\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eimage/x-portable-bitmap\u003c/code\u003e.  Some file formats have official MIME types but may sometimes be referred to using their previous unofficial designations, such as \u003ccode\u003eimage/x-png\u003c/code\u003e instead of the official \u003ccode\u003eimage/png\u003c/code\u003e.  Finally, a single service provider may be capable of parsing multiple distinct types from the MIME point of view, for example \u003ccode\u003eimage/x-xbitmap\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eimage/x-xpixmap\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e Returning a particular MIME type does not guarantee that files claiming to be of that type can be processed; it merely indicates that it may be worthwhile attempting to decode or encode such files using this service provider.\n * @return an array of \u003ccode\u003eString\u003c/code\u003es or length at least 1containing MIME types associated with this reader or writer, or \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"reason":1,"singl":2,"least":1,"servic":4,"particular":2,"type":10,"necessari":1,"distinct":1,"requir":2,"xpixmap":1,"refer":1,"file":4,"unoffici":2,"offici":2,"howev":1,"writer":2,"xbitmap":1,"decod":1,"mani":1,"bitmap":1,"multipl":1,"describ":1,"format":4,"imag":9,"provid":4,"encod":1,"reader":2,"contain":2,"will":1,"mere":1,"view":1,"array":2,"attempt":1,"common":2,"portabl":1,"use":3,"pbm":1,"indic":1,"order":1,"associ":4,"name":1,"length":1,"sometim":1,"worthwhil":1,"usabl":1,"may":3,"standard":1,"previous":1,"guarante":1,"ideal":1,"list":3,"capabl":1,"sever":1,"general":1,"process":1,"point":1,"png":2,"string":2,"exampl":1,"instead":1,"claim":1,"first":1,"pars":1,"design":1},"maxFreq":10,"totalTerms":114},"loc":3}
