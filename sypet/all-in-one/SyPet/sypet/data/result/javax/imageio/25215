It may even choose to advertise tiling when none is explicitly present.  In general, tiling should only be advertised if there is some advantage (in speed or space) to accessing individual tiles. Regardless of whether the reader advertises tiling, it must be capable of reading an arbitrary rectangular region specified in an \u003ccode\u003eImageReadParam\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e A reader for which all images are guaranteed to be tiled, or are guaranteed not to be tiled, may return \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e respectively without accessing any image data.
