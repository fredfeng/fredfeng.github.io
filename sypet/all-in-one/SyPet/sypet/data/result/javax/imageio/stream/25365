Unlike a standard \u003ccode\u003eInputStream\u003c/code\u003e, all \u003ccode\u003eImageInputStream\u003c/code\u003es support marking.  Additionally, calls to \u003ccode\u003emark\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ereset\u003c/code\u003e may be nested arbitrarily. \u003cp\u003e Unlike the \u003ccode\u003emark\u003c/code\u003e methods declared by the \u003ccode\u003eReader\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eInputStream\u003c/code\u003e interfaces, no \u003ccode\u003ereadLimit\u003c/code\u003e parameter is used.  An arbitrary amount of data may be read following the call to \u003ccode\u003emark\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e The bit position used by the \u003ccode\u003ereadBits\u003c/code\u003e method is saved and restored by each pair of calls to \u003ccode\u003emark\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ereset\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e Note that it is valid for an \u003ccode\u003eImageReader\u003c/code\u003e to call \u003ccode\u003eflushBefore\u003c/code\u003e as part of a read operation. Therefore, if an application calls \u003ccode\u003emark\u003c/code\u003e prior to passing that stream to an \u003ccode\u003eImageReader\u003c/code\u003e, the application should not assume that the marked position will remain valid after the read operation has completed.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"valid":2,"call":6,"stream":5,"save":1,"pair":1,"data":1,"use":2,"therefor":1,"applic":2,"prior":1,"amount":1,"arbitrari":1,"declar":1,"oper":2,"unlik":2,"arbitrarili":1,"reset":3,"read":5,"subsequ":1,"note":1,"complet":1,"follow":1,"limit":1,"addit":1,"may":2,"assum":1,"support":1,"standard":1,"nest":1,"paramet":1,"mark":9,"imag":3,"pass":1,"bit":2,"input":3,"flush":1,"reader":3,"remain":1,"will":1,"restor":1,"method":2,"part":1,"posit":3},"maxFreq":9,"totalTerms":82},"loc":0}
