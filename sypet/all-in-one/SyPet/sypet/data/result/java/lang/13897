The thread releases ownership of this monitor and waits until another thread notifies threads waiting on this object\u0027s monitor to wake up either through a call to the  {@code notify} method or the{@code notifyAll} method. The thread then waits until it canre-obtain ownership of the monitor and resumes execution. \u003cp\u003e As in the one argument version, interrupts and spurious wakeups are possible, and this method should always be used in a loop: \u003cpre\u003e synchronized (obj) { while (\u0026lt;condition does not hold\u0026gt;) obj.wait(); ... // Perform action appropriate to condition } \u003c/pre\u003e This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner of this object\u0027s monitor.
