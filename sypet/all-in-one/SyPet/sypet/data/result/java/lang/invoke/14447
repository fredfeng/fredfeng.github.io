(The name is the one reported by  {@link java.lang.Class#getName() Class.getName}.) If there are restrictions on the access permitted to this lookup, this is indicated by adding a suffix to the class name, consisting of a slash and a keyword.  The keyword represents the strongest allowed access, and is chosen as follows: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003eIf no access is allowed, the suffix is \"/noaccess\". \u003cli\u003eIf only public access is allowed, the suffix is \"/public\". \u003cli\u003eIf only public and package access are allowed, the suffix is \"/package\". \u003cli\u003eIf only public, package, and private access are allowed, the suffix is \"/private\". \u003c/ul\u003e If none of the above cases apply, it is the case that full access (public, package, private, and protected) is allowed. In this case, no suffix is added. This is true only of an object obtained originally from {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#lookup MethodHandles.lookup}. Objects created by  {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles.Lookup#in Lookup.in}always have restricted access, and will display a suffix. \u003cp\u003e (It may seem strange that protected access should be stronger than private access.  Viewed independently from package access, protected access is the first to be lost, because it requires a direct subclass relationship between caller and callee.)\n * @see #in\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"permit":1,"strang":1,"lookup":6,"independ":1,"requir":1,"report":1,"none":1,"follow":1,"consist":1,"creat":1,"invok":2,"alway":1,"stronger":1,"display":2,"restrict":2,"appli":1,"obtain":1,"subclass":1,"will":1,"view":1,"calle":1,"caller":1,"lost":1,"allow":6,"one":1,"link":3,"made":1,"chosen":1,"object":2,"lang":3,"indic":1,"full":1,"name":5,"direct":1,"may":1,"slash":1,"repres":1,"keyword":2,"origin":1,"true":1,"access":12,"suffix":7,"seem":1,"handl":3,"relationship":1,"strongest":1,"string":1,"ad":2,"java":3,"method":3,"first":1,"noaccess":1},"maxFreq":12,"totalTerms":99},"loc":21}
