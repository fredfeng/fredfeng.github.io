This method will return a zero-length array if this thread has not started, has started but has not yet been scheduled to run by the system, or has terminated. If the returned array is of non-zero length then the first element of the array represents the top of the stack, which is the most recent method invocation in the sequence.  The last element of the array represents the bottom of the stack, which is the least recent method invocation in the sequence. \u003cp\u003eIf there is a security manager, and this thread is not the current thread, then the security manager\u0027s \u003ctt\u003echeckPermission\u003c/tt\u003e method is called with a \u003ctt\u003eRuntimePermission(\"getStackTrace\")\u003c/tt\u003e permission to see if it\u0027s ok to get the stack trace. \u003cp\u003eSome virtual machines may, under some circumstances, omit one or more stack frames from the stack trace.
