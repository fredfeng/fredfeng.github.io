For example, the standard defines a \"Basic Latin\" block. Therefore, this method accepts \"Basic Latin\" as a valid block name. The documentation of each UnicodeBlock provides the canonical name. \u003cli\u003eCanonical block names with all spaces removed. For example, \"BasicLatin\" is a valid block name for the \"Basic Latin\" block. \u003cli\u003eThe text representation of each constant UnicodeBlock identifier.
