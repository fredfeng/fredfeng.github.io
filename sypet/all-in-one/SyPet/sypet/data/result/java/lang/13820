{"id":13820,"className":"java.lang.ProcessBuilder","methodName":"environment","signature":"\u003cjava.lang.ProcessBuilder: java.util.Map\u003cjava.lang.String,java.lang.String\u003e environment()\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Returns a string map view of this process builder\u0027s environment. Whenever a process builder is created, the environment is initialized to a copy of the current process environment (see {@link System#getenv()}).  Subprocesses subsequently started by this object\u0027s  {@link #start()} method will use this map astheir environment. \u003cp\u003eThe returned object may be modified using ordinary  {@link java.util.Map Map} operations.  These modifications will bevisible to subprocesses started via the  {@link #start()}method.  Two  {@code ProcessBuilder} instances alwayscontain independent process environments, so changes to the returned map will never be reflected in any other {@code ProcessBuilder} instance or the values returned by{@link System#getenv System.getenv}. \u003cp\u003eIf the system does not support environment variables, an empty map is returned. \u003cp\u003eThe returned map does not permit null keys or values. Attempting to insert or query the presence of a null key or value will throw a  {@link NullPointerException}. Attempting to query the presence of a key or value which is not of type  {@link String} will throw a {@link ClassCastException}. \u003cp\u003eThe behavior of the returned map is system-dependent.  A system may not allow modifications to environment variables or may forbid certain variable names or values.  For this reason, attempts to modify the map may fail with {@link UnsupportedOperationException} or{@link IllegalArgumentException}if the modification is not permitted by the operating system. \u003cp\u003eSince the external format of environment variable names and values is system-dependent, there may not be a one-to-one mapping between them and Java\u0027s Unicode strings.  Nevertheless, the map is implemented in such a way that environment variables which are not modified by Java code will have an unmodified native representation in the subprocess. \u003cp\u003eThe returned map and its collection views may not obey the general contract of the  {@link Object#equals} and{@link Object#hashCode} methods.\u003cp\u003eThe returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms. \u003cp\u003eIf a security manager exists, its {@link SecurityManager#checkPermission checkPermission} methodis called with a {@link RuntimePermission}{@code (\"getenv.*\")} permission.This may result in a  {@link SecurityException} being thrown.\u003cp\u003eWhen passing information to a Java subprocess, \u003ca href\u003dSystem.html#EnvironmentVSSystemProperties\u003esystem properties\u003c/a\u003e are generally preferred over environment variables.\n * @return this process builder\u0027s environment\n * @throws SecurityException if a security manager exists and its {@link SecurityManager#checkPermission checkPermission}method doesn\u0027t allow access to the process environment\n * @see Runtime#exec(String[],String[],java.io.File)\n * @see System#getenv()\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"subprocess":4,"unsupport":1,"via":1,"reason":1,"variabl":6,"permit":2,"type":1,"copi":1,"nevertheless":1,"ordinari":1,"independ":1,"fail":1,"oper":3,"file":1,"permiss":6,"methodi":1,"href":1,"key":3,"argument":1,"platform":1,"presenc":2,"thrown":1,"sensit":1,"except":6,"bevis":1,"support":1,"hash":1,"contract":1,"creat":1,"runtim":2,"environ":14,"builder":5,"format":1,"astheir":1,"instanc":2,"inform":1,"obey":1,"queri":2,"system":12,"cast":1,"start":4,"will":6,"pointer":1,"exec":1,"properti":2,"view":2,"prefer":1,"forbid":1,"util":1,"collect":1,"attempt":3,"result":1,"call":1,"allow":2,"behavior":1,"one":2,"link":16,"typic":1,"way":1,"use":2,"object":4,"alwayscontain":1,"extern":1,"name":2,"map":13,"current":1,"valu":6,"initi":1,"subsequ":1,"exist":2,"getenv":5,"whenev":1,"may":7,"check":4,"manag":4,"depend":2,"equal":1,"access":1,"illeg":1,"general":2,"pass":1,"represent":1,"empti":1,"process":8,"two":1,"unmodifi":1,"never":1,"secur":6,"string":5,"unicod":1,"modifi":3,"html":1,"method":4,"java":5,"certain":1,"chang":1,"insert":1,"modif":3,"reflect":1},"maxFreq":16,"totalTerms":251},"loc":12}
