On the first call to this method, it first creates the platform {@code MBeanServer} by calling the{@link javax.management.MBeanServerFactory#createMBeanServer MBeanServerFactory.createMBeanServer}method and registers each platform MXBean in this platform {@code MBeanServer} with its{@link PlatformManagedObject#getObjectName ObjectName}. This method, in subsequent calls, will simply return the initially created platform  {@code MBeanServer}. \u003cp\u003e MXBeans that get created and destroyed dynamically, for example, memory  {@link MemoryPoolMXBean pools} and{@link MemoryManagerMXBean managers}, will automatically be registered and deregistered into the platform {@code MBeanServer}. \u003cp\u003e If the system property  {@code javax.management.builder.initial}is set, the platform  {@code MBeanServer} creation will be doneby the specified  {@link javax.management.MBeanServerBuilder}. \u003cp\u003e It is recommended that this platform MBeanServer also be used to register other application managed beans besides the platform MXBeans. This will allow all MBeans to be published through the same {@code MBeanServer} and hence allow for easier network publishingand discovery.
