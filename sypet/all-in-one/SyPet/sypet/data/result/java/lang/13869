Which commands are valid is system-dependent, but at the very least the command must be a non-empty list of non-null strings. \u003cp\u003eIf \u003ctt\u003eenvp\u003c/tt\u003e is \u003ctt\u003enull\u003c/tt\u003e, the subprocess inherits the environment settings of the current process. \u003cp\u003eA minimal set of system dependent environment variables may be required to start a process on some operating systems. As a result, the subprocess may inherit additional environment variable settings beyond those in the specified environment. \u003cp\u003e {@link ProcessBuilder#start()} is now the preferred way tostart a process with a modified environment. \u003cp\u003eThe working directory of the new subprocess is specified by \u003ctt\u003edir\u003c/tt\u003e.
