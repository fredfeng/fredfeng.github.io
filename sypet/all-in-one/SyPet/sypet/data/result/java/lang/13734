More generally, if it would cause problems for an exception to be suppressed, the  {@code AutoCloseable.close}method should not throw it. \u003cp\u003eNote that unlike the  {@link java.io.Closeable#close close}method of  {@link java.io.Closeable}, this  {@code close} methodis \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e required to be idempotent.  In other words, calling this  {@code close} method more than once may have somevisible side effect, unlike  {@code Closeable.close} which isrequired to have no effect if called more than once. However, implementers of this interface are strongly encouraged to make their  {@code close} methods idempotent.\n * @throws Exception if this resource cannot be closed\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"closeabl":4,"idempot":2,"advis":1,"close":13,"requir":1,"fail":1,"oper":1,"thread":1,"encourag":2,"methodi":1,"howev":1,"except":8,"status":1,"invok":1,"runtim":1,"like":1,"statement":1,"strong":3,"auto":1,"word":1,"make":1,"linkplain":1,"call":2,"isrequir":1,"link":3,"object":1,"add":1,"automat":1,"misbehavior":1,"resourc":4,"declar":2,"side":1,"concret":1,"unlik":2,"somevis":1,"note":1,"may":1,"manag":1,"problem":1,"interrupt":3,"general":1,"specif":1,"caus":1,"effect":2,"relinquish":1,"tothrow":1,"interact":1,"method":8,"java":2,"throwabl":1,"also":1,"suppress":3,"occur":1},"maxFreq":13,"totalTerms":100},"loc":0}
