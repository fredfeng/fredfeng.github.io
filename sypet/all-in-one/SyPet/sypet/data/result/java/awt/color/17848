Component must be \u003ccode\u003eREDCOMPONENT\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eGREENCOMPONENT\u003c/code\u003e, or \u003ccode\u003eBLUECOMPONENT\u003c/code\u003e. Otherwise the returned array represents a lookup table where the input component value is conceptually in the range [0.0, 1.0].  Value 0.0 maps to array index 0 and value 1.0 maps to array index length-1. Interpolation might be used to generate output values for input values that do not map exactly to an index in the array.  Output values also map linearly to the range [0.0, 1.0]. Value 0.0 is represented by an array value of 0x0000 and value 1.0 by 0xFFFF.  In other words, the values are really unsigned \u003ccode\u003eshort\u003c/code\u003e values even though they are returned in a \u003ccode\u003eshort\u003c/code\u003e array. If the profile has specified the corresponding TRC as linear (gamma \u003d 1.0) or as a simple gamma value, this method throws an exception.  In this case, the  {@link #getGamma(int)}method should be used to get the gamma value.\n * @param component The \u003cCODE\u003eICC_ProfileRGB\u003c/CODE\u003e constant thatrepresents the component whose TRC you want to retrieve: \u003cCODE\u003eREDCOMPONENT\u003c/CODE\u003e, \u003cCODE\u003eGREENCOMPONENT\u003c/CODE\u003e, or \u003cCODE\u003eBLUECOMPONENT\u003c/CODE\u003e.\n * @return a short array representing the TRC.\n * @exception ProfileDataException if the profile does not specifythe corresponding TRC as a table.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"otherwis":1,"might":1,"realli":1,"simpl":1,"correspond":2,"link":1,"data":1,"particular":1,"use":2,"lookup":1,"though":1,"must":1,"specifi":1,"gamma":4,"rang":2,"interpol":1,"exact":1,"map":4,"length":1,"valu":13,"want":1,"profil":4,"except":3,"index":3,"linear":2,"constant":1,"whose":1,"repres":3,"conceptu":1,"thatrepres":1,"input":2,"compon":5,"retriev":1,"unsign":1,"tabl":2,"generat":1,"method":2,"even":1,"word":1,"specifyth":1,"output":2,"also":1,"array":8},"maxFreq":13,"totalTerms":89},"loc":25}
