No action will take place is this Window is not visible. Some platforms do not allow Windows which are owned by other Windows to appear below their owners. Every attempt will be made to move this Window as low as possible in the stacking order; however, developers should not assume that this method will move this Window below all other windows in every situation. \u003cp\u003e Because of variations in native windowing systems, no guarantees about changes to the focused and active Windows can be made. Developers must never assume that this Window is no longer the focused or active Window until this Window receives a WINDOW_LOST_FOCUS or WINDOW_DEACTIVATED event. On platforms where the top-most window is the focused window, this method will \u003cb\u003eprobably\u003c/b\u003e cause this Window to lose focus. In that case, the next highest, focusable Window in this VM will receive focus.
