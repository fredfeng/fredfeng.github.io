{"id":15378,"className":"java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment","methodName":"preferLocaleFonts","signature":"\u003cjava.awt.GraphicsEnvironment: void preferLocaleFonts()\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Indicates a preference for locale-specific fonts in the mapping of logical fonts to physical fonts. Calling this method indicates that font rendering should primarily use fonts specific to the primary writing system (the one indicated by the default encoding and the initial default locale). For example, if the primary writing system is Japanese, then characters should be rendered using a Japanese font if possible, and other fonts should only be used for characters for which the Japanese font doesn\u0027t have glyphs. \u003cp\u003e The actual change in font rendering behavior resulting from a call to this method is implementation dependent; it may have no effect at all, or the requested behavior may already match the default behavior. The behavior may differ between font rendering in lightweight and peered components.  Since calling this method requests a different font, clients should expect different metrics, and may need to recalculate window sizes and layout. Therefore this method should be called before user interface initialisation.\n * @since 1.5\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"result":1,"call":4,"client":1,"japanes":3,"behavior":4,"one":1,"use":3,"possibl":1,"therefor":1,"primarili":1,"expect":1,"indic":3,"layout":1,"request":2,"map":1,"write":2,"initi":1,"primari":2,"peer":1,"recalcul":1,"may":4,"initialis":1,"charact":2,"depend":1,"physic":1,"font":12,"glyph":1,"logic":1,"size":1,"render":4,"differ":3,"specif":2,"system":2,"encod":1,"window":1,"compon":1,"effect":1,"metric":1,"exampl":1,"actual":1,"alreadi":1,"method":4,"lightweight":1,"match":1,"chang":1,"local":3,"prefer":2,"user":1},"maxFreq":12,"totalTerms":92},"loc":4}
