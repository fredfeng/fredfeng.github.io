For TYPE_XYZ spaces, this method returns maximum values of 1.0 + (32767.0 / 32768.0) for all components. For TYPE_Lab spaces, this method returns 100.0 for L and 127.0 for a and b components. This is consistent with the encoding of the XYZ and Lab Profile Connection Spaces in the ICC specification.  For all other types, this method returns 1.0 for all components.  When using an ICC_ColorSpace with a profile that requires different maximum component values, it is necessary to subclass this class and override this method.\n * @param component The component index.\n * @return The maximum normalized component value.\n * @throws IllegalArgumentException if component is less than 0 orgreater than numComponents - 1.\n * @since 1.4\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"connect":1,"normal":2,"use":1,"space":4,"type":1,"lab":2,"necessari":1,"specifi":1,"requir":1,"orgreat":1,"valu":5,"less":1,"profil":2,"argument":1,"except":1,"index":1,"max":1,"consist":1,"illeg":1,"differ":1,"num":1,"encod":1,"specif":1,"compon":11,"color":2,"maximum":4,"subclass":1,"method":4},"maxFreq":11,"totalTerms":55},"loc":7}
