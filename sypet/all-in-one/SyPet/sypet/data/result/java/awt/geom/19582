The determinant is useful both to determine if the transform can be inverted and to get a single value representing the combined X and Y scaling of the transform. \u003cp\u003e If the determinant is non-zero, then this transform is invertible and the various methods that depend on the inverse transform do not need to throw a {@link NoninvertibleTransformException}. If the determinant is zero then this transform can not be inverted since the transform maps all input coordinates onto a line or a point. If the determinant is near enough to zero then inverse transform operations might not carry enough precision to produce meaningful results. \u003cp\u003e If this transform represents a uniform scale, as indicated by the \u003ccode\u003egetType\u003c/code\u003e method then the determinant also represents the square of the uniform scale factor by which all of the points are expanded from or contracted towards the origin. If this transform represents a non-uniform scale or more general transform then the determinant is not likely to represent a value useful for any purpose other than determining if inverse transforms are possible. \u003cp\u003e Mathematically, the determinant is calculated using the formula: \u003cpre\u003e |  m00  m01  m02  | |  m10  m11  m12  |  \u003d  m00 * m11 - m01 * m10 |   0    0    1   | \u003c/pre\u003e\n * @return the determinant of the matrix used to transform thecoordinates.\n * @see #getType\n * @see #createInverse\n * @see #inverseTransform\n * @see #TYPE_UNIFORM_SCALE\n * @since 1.2\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"squar":1,"singl":1,"possibl":1,"zero":3,"enough":2,"carri":1,"type":2,"thecoordin":1,"toward":1,"oper":1,"combin":1,"precis":1,"purpos":1,"expand":1,"coordin":1,"onto":1,"except":1,"creat":1,"contract":1,"calcul":1,"like":1,"non":2,"input":1,"near":1,"determin":12,"scale":4,"might":1,"result":1,"link":1,"use":4,"line":1,"invert":3,"transform":15,"invers":5,"indic":1,"map":1,"various":1,"valu":2,"noninvert":1,"repres":5,"uniform":3,"mathemat":1,"depend":1,"matrix":2,"origin":1,"produc":1,"meaning":1,"factor":1,"general":1,"represent":1,"point":2,"pre":2,"method":2,"also":1,"formula":1},"maxFreq":15,"totalTerms":109},"loc":19}
