To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of the interior of the path would require extensive calculations involving all of the segments of the path and the winding rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation.\n * @since 1.6\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"rectangular":1,"interior":3,"retrac":1,"scope":1,"exterior":1,"segment":6,"cancel":1,"object":1,"whether":1,"beyond":1,"specifi":1,"revers":1,"requir":1,"area":2,"extens":1,"rule":1,"path":5,"direct":1,"wind":1,"may":2,"thus":1,"repres":2,"calcul":1,"conserv":1,"true":2,"involv":1,"without":1,"two":1,"intersect":2,"determin":1,"method":1,"boundari":2,"occur":1},"maxFreq":6,"totalTerms":50},"loc":20}
