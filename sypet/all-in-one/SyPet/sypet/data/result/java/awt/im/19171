This information is, for example, used to position the candidate window near the composed text, or a composition window near the location where committed text will be inserted. \u003cp\u003e If the component has composed text (because the most recent InputMethodEvent sent to it contained composed text), then the offset is relative to the composed text - offset 0 indicates the first character in the composed text. The location returned should be for this character. \u003cp\u003e If the component doesn\u0027t have composed text, the offset should be ignored, and the location returned should reflect the beginning (in line direction) of the highlight in the last line containing selected text. For example, for horizontal left-to-right text (such as English), the location to the left of the left-most character on the last line containing selected text is returned. For vertical top-to-bottom text, with lines proceding from right to left, the location to the top of the left-most line containing selected text is returned. \u003cp\u003e The location is represented as a 0-thickness caret, that is, it has 0 width if the text is drawn horizontally, and 0 height if the text is drawn vertically. Other text orientations need to be mapped to horizontal or vertical orientation. The rectangle uses absolute screen coordinates.\n * @param offset the offset within the composed text, if there is composedtext; null otherwise\n * @return a rectangle representing the screen location of the offset\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"last":2,"proced":1,"highlight":1,"specifi":1,"sent":1,"height":1,"commit":2,"event":1,"relat":1,"right":2,"coordin":1,"screen":2,"text":19,"ignor":1,"vertic":3,"composit":1,"charact":3,"select":4,"width":1,"candid":1,"absolut":1,"inform":1,"input":1,"composedtext":1,"near":2,"window":2,"thick":1,"contain":4,"will":1,"bottom":1,"posit":1,"english":1,"otherwis":1,"use":2,"line":5,"rectangl":2,"recent":1,"indic":1,"map":1,"current":1,"horizont":3,"left":5,"offset":7,"drawn":2,"top":2,"direct":1,"locat":9,"repres":2,"compos":8,"begin":1,"caret":1,"orient":2,"compon":2,"exampl":2,"method":1,"within":1,"insert":1,"first":1,"reflect":1},"maxFreq":19,"totalTerms":133},"loc":0}
