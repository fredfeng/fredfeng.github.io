If an event with a timestamp is currently being dispatched, its timestamp will be returned. If no events have yet been dispatched, the EventQueue\u0027s initialization time will be returned instead.In the current version of the JDK, only \u003ccode\u003eInputEvent\u003c/code\u003es, \u003ccode\u003eActionEvent\u003c/code\u003es, and \u003ccode\u003eInvocationEvent\u003c/code\u003es have timestamps; however, future versions of the JDK may add timestamps to additional event types.
