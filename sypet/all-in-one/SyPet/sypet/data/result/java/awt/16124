This priority hint is used to compare to the priorities of other Image objects when determining how to use scarce acceleration resources such as video memory.  When and if it is possible to accelerate this Image, if there are not enough resources available to provide that acceleration but enough can be freed up by de-accelerating some other image of lower priority, then that other Image may be de-accelerated in deference to this one.  Images that have the same priority take up resources on a first-come, first-served basis.\n * @param priority a value between 0 and 1, inclusive, where highervalues indicate more importance for acceleration.  A value of 0 means that this Image should never be accelerated.  Other values are used simply to determine acceleration priority relative to other Images.\n * @throws IllegalArgumentException if \u003ccode\u003epriority\u003c/code\u003e is lessthan zero or greater than 1.\n * @since 1.5\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"simpli":1,"memori":1,"greater":1,"lower":1,"one":1,"use":3,"possibl":1,"object":1,"zero":1,"enough":2,"inclus":1,"defer":1,"resourc":3,"indic":1,"lessthan":1,"relat":1,"mean":1,"valu":3,"serv":1,"video":1,"argument":1,"except":1,"may":1,"prioriti":8,"come":1,"hint":2,"avail":1,"imag":8,"illeg":1,"provid":1,"never":1,"acceler":10,"take":1,"determin":2,"freed":1,"highervalu":1,"scarc":1,"basi":1,"compar":1,"first":2},"maxFreq":10,"totalTerms":73},"loc":10}
