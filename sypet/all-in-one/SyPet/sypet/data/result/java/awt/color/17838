This means that the XYZ values returned by this method are represented relative to the D50 white point of the CS_CIEXYZ color space. This representation is useful in a two-step color conversion process in which colors are transformed from an input color space to CS_CIEXYZ and then to an output color space.  This representation is not the same as the XYZ values that would be measured from the given color value by a colorimeter. A further transformation is necessary to compute the XYZ values that would be measured using current CIE recommended practices.
