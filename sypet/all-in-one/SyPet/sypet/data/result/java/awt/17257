The size of the scroll bar\u0027s bubble (also called a thumb or scroll box), usually gives a visual representation of the relationship of the visible amount to the range of the scroll bar. Note that depending on platform, the value of the visible amount property may not be visually indicated by the size of the bubble. \u003cp\u003e The scroll bar\u0027s bubble may not be displayed when it is not moveable (e.g. when it takes up the entire length of the scroll bar\u0027s track, or when the scroll bar is disabled).
