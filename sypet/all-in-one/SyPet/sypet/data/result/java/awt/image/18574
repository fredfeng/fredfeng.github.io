Note that the VolatileImage object is optimized for rendering operations and blitting to the screen or other VolatileImage objects, as opposed to reading back the pixels of the image.  Therefore, operations such as \u003ccode\u003egetSource\u003c/code\u003e may not perform as fast as operations that do not rely on reading the pixels. Note also that the pixel values read from the image are current with those in the image only at the time that they are retrieved. This method takes a snapshot of the image at the time the request is made and the ImageProducer object returned works with that static snapshot image, not the original VolatileImage. Calling getSource() is equivalent to calling getSnapshot().getSource().\n * @return an {@link ImageProducer} that can be used to produce thepixels for a \u003ccode\u003eBufferedImage\u003c/code\u003e representation of this Image.\n * @see ImageProducer\n * @see #getSnapshot()\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"call":2,"pixel":3,"link":1,"made":1,"use":1,"perform":1,"object":3,"therefor":1,"blit":1,"reli":1,"buffer":1,"time":2,"equival":1,"oper":3,"request":1,"current":1,"read":3,"valu":1,"note":2,"work":1,"screen":1,"may":1,"optim":1,"snapshot":4,"thepixel":1,"origin":1,"back":1,"produc":5,"imag":15,"represent":1,"render":1,"oppos":1,"take":1,"retriev":1,"method":1,"sourc":4,"fast":1,"also":1},"maxFreq":15,"totalTerms":73},"loc":14}
