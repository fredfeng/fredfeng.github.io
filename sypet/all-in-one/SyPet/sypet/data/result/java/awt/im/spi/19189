The locale may describe just the language, or may also include country and variant information if needed.

It may also be used to sort input methods by locale in a user-visible list of input methods. \u003cp\u003e Only the input method\u0027s primary locales should be returned. For example, if a Japanese input method also has a pass-through mode for Roman characters, typically still only Japanese would be returned. Thus, the list of locales returned is typically a subset of the locales for which the corresponding input method\u0027s implementation of  {@link java.awt.im.spi.InputMethod#setLocale} returns true.\u003cp\u003e If  {@link #hasDynamicLocaleList} returns true, this method iscalled each time the information is needed.
