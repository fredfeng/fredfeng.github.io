It is expected that all KeyboardFocusManagers will dispatch all FocusEvents, all WindowEvents related to focus, and all KeyEvents. These events should be dispatched based on the KeyboardFocusManager\u0027s notion of the focus owner and the focused and active Windows, sometimes overriding the source of the specified AWTEvent. Dispatching must be done using \u003ccode\u003eredispatchEvent\u003c/code\u003e to prevent the AWT event dispatcher from recursively requesting that the KeyboardFocusManager dispatch the event again. If this method returns \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e, then the AWT event dispatcher will attempt to dispatch the event itself.\n * @param e the AWTEvent to be dispatched\n * @return \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e if this method dispatched the event;\u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e otherwise\n * @see #redispatchEvent\n * @see #dispatchKeyEvent\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"otherwis":1,"attempt":1,"fals":2,"behalf":1,"call":1,"use":1,"activ":1,"must":1,"specifi":2,"expect":1,"event":15,"tevent":2,"request":2,"current":1,"relat":1,"focus":8,"dispatch":13,"sometim":1,"key":2,"keyboard":4,"notion":1,"manag":4,"done":1,"true":1,"prevent":1,"window":2,"will":2,"base":1,"owner":1,"method":3,"sourc":1,"recurs":1,"redispatch":2},"maxFreq":15,"totalTerms":82},"loc":0}
