The resulting clipping area is the intersection of the current clipping area and the specified rectangle.  If there is no current clipping area, either because the clip has never been set, or the clip has been cleared using \u003ccode\u003esetClip(null)\u003c/code\u003e, the specified rectangle becomes the new clip. This method sets the user clip, which is independent of the clipping associated with device bounds and window visibility. This method can only be used to make the current clip smaller. To set the current clip larger, use any of the setClip methods.
