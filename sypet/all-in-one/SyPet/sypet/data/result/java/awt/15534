{"id":15534,"className":"java.awt.KeyEventDispatcher","methodName":"dispatchKeyEvent","signature":"\u003cjava.awt.KeyEventDispatcher: boolean dispatchKeyEvent(java.awt.event.KeyEvent)\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * This method is called by the current KeyboardFocusManager requesting that this KeyEventDispatcher dispatch the specified event on its behalf. This KeyEventDispatcher is free to retarget the event, consume it, dispatch it itself, or make other changes. This capability is typically used to deliver KeyEvents to Components other than the focus owner. This can be useful when navigating children of non-focusable Windows in an accessible environment, for example. Note that if a KeyEventDispatcher dispatches the KeyEvent itself, it must use \u003ccode\u003eredispatchEvent\u003c/code\u003e to prevent the current KeyboardFocusManager from recursively requesting that this KeyEventDispatcher dispatch the event again. \u003cp\u003e If an implementation of this method returns \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e, then the KeyEvent is passed to the next KeyEventDispatcher in the chain, ending with the current KeyboardFocusManager. If an implementation returns \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e, the KeyEvent is assumed to have been dispatched (although this need not be the case), and the current KeyboardFocusManager will take no further action with regard to the KeyEvent. In such a case, \u003ccode\u003eKeyboardFocusManager.dispatchEvent\u003c/code\u003e should return \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e as well. If an implementation consumes the KeyEvent, but returns \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e, the consumed event will still be passed to the next KeyEventDispatcher in the chain. It is important for developers to check whether the KeyEvent has been consumed before dispatching it to a target. By default, the current KeyboardFocusManager will not dispatch a consumed KeyEvent.\n * @param e the KeyEvent to dispatch\n * @return \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e if the KeyboardFocusManager should take nofurther action with regard to the KeyEvent; \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e otherwise\n * @see KeyboardFocusManager#redispatchEvent\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"behalf":1,"fals":3,"need":1,"whether":1,"must":1,"specifi":1,"free":1,"although":1,"event":24,"request":2,"action":2,"focus":10,"key":17,"nofurth":1,"environ":1,"prevent":1,"regard":2,"non":1,"window":1,"owner":1,"will":3,"make":1,"recurs":1,"redispatch":2,"otherwis":1,"call":1,"next":2,"typic":1,"use":3,"children":1,"well":1,"navig":1,"consum":5,"current":5,"dispatch":16,"develop":1,"note":1,"end":1,"keyboard":8,"assum":1,"check":1,"manag":8,"retarget":1,"true":3,"still":1,"capabl":1,"access":1,"pass":2,"compon":1,"chain":2,"take":2,"target":1,"deliv":1,"exampl":1,"method":2,"chang":1},"maxFreq":24,"totalTerms":158},"loc":0}
