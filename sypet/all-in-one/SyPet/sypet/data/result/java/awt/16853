You can assume that the background is not cleared. \u003cp\u003e The \u003ccode\u003eupdate\u003c/code\u003e method of \u003ccode\u003eComponent\u003c/code\u003e calls this component\u0027s \u003ccode\u003epaint\u003c/code\u003e method to redraw this component.  This method is commonly overridden by subclasses which need to do additional work in response to a call to \u003ccode\u003erepaint\u003c/code\u003e. Subclasses of Component that override this method should either call \u003ccode\u003esuper.update(g)\u003c/code\u003e, or call \u003ccode\u003epaint(g)\u003c/code\u003e directly from their \u003ccode\u003eupdate\u003c/code\u003e method. \u003cp\u003e The origin of the graphics context, its (\u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e,\u0026nbsp;\u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e) coordinate point, is the top-left corner of this component.
