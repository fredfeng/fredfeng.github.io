This would allow programmers to find out more runtime information on the specific VolatileImage object that they have created.  For example, the user might create a VolatileImage but the system may have no video memory left for creating an image of that size, so although the object is a VolatileImage, it is not as accelerated as other VolatileImage objects on this platform might be.
