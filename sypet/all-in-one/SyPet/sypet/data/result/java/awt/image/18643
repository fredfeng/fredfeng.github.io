A notable case where multiple ColorModel objects may be seen is a filtered image when for each set of pixels that it filters, the filter determines  whether the pixels can be sent on untouched, using the original ColorModel, or whether the pixels should be modified (filtered) and passed on using a ColorModel more convenient for the filtering process.\n * @param model the specified \u003ccode\u003eColorModel\u003c/code\u003e\n * @see ColorModel\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"call":1,"model":10,"pixel":8,"one":1,"made":1,"notabl":1,"use":6,"object":3,"whether":2,"specifi":1,"sent":1,"report":1,"valu":1,"conveni":1,"note":1,"major":1,"may":1,"multipl":1,"origin":1,"seen":1,"imag":1,"pass":1,"process":1,"color":8,"contain":1,"determin":1,"modifi":1,"deliv":2,"will":1,"method":1,"untouch":1,"assumpt":1,"filter":5},"maxFreq":10,"totalTerms":69},"loc":0}
