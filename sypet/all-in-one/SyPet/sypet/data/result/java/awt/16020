If the given background color is {@code null}, the window is considered completely opaque. \u003cp\u003e All the following conditions must be met to enable the per-pixel transparency mode for this window: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003eThe  {@link GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency#PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT} translucency must be supported by the graphicsdevice where this window is located \u003cli\u003eThe window must be undecorated (see  {@link Frame#setUndecorated}and  {@link Dialog#setUndecorated}) \u003cli\u003eThe window must not be in full-screen mode (see  {@link GraphicsDevice#setFullScreenWindow(Window)}) \u003c/ul\u003e \u003cp\u003e If the alpha component of the requested background color is less than {@code 1.0f}, and any of the above conditions are not met, the background color of this window will not change, the alpha component of the given background color will not affect the mode of operation for this window, and either the  {@code UnsupportedOperationException} or {@code IllegalComponentStateException} will be thrown.\u003cp\u003e When the window is per-pixel translucent, the drawing sub-system respects the alpha value of each individual pixel. If a pixel gets painted with the alpha color component equal to zero, it becomes visually transparent. If the alpha of the pixel is equal to 1.0f, the pixel is fully opaque. Interim values of the alpha color component make the pixel semi-transparent. In this mode, the background of the window gets painted with the alpha value of the given background color. If the alpha value of the argument of this method is equal to  {@code 0}, the background is not painted at all. \u003cp\u003e The actual level of translucency of a given pixel also depends on window opacity (see  {@link #setOpacity(float)}), as well as the current shape of this window (see  {@link #setShape(Shape)}). \u003cp\u003e Note that painting a pixel with the alpha value of  {@code 0} may or maynot disable the mouse event handling on this pixel. This is a platform-dependent behavior. To make sure the mouse events do not get dispatched to a particular pixel, the pixel must be excluded from the shape of the window. \u003cp\u003e Enabling the per-pixel translucency mode may change the graphics configuration of this window due to the native platform requirements.\n * @param bgColor the color to become this window\u0027s background color.\n * @throws IllegalComponentStateException if the alpha value of the givenbackground color is less than  {@code 1.0f} and the window is decorated\n * @throws IllegalComponentStateException if the alpha value of the givenbackground color is less than  {@code 1.0f} and the window is infull-screen mode\n * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if the alpha value of the givenbackground color is less than  {@code 1.0f} and {@link GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency#PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT PERPIXEL_TRANSLUCENT} translucency is not supported\n * @see Window#getBackground\n * @see Window#isOpaque\n * @see Window#setOpacity(float)\n * @see Window#setShape(Shape)\n * @see Frame#isUndecorated\n * @see Dialog#isUndecorated\n * @see GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency\n * @see GraphicsDevice#isWindowTranslucencySupported(GraphicsDevice.WindowTranslucency)\n * @see GraphicsConfiguration#isTranslucencyCapable()\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"unsupport":2,"givenbackground":3,"particular":1,"zero":1,"mous":2,"must":6,"whether":1,"decor":1,"draw":1,"requir":1,"level":1,"becom":2,"trancluc":1,"given":5,"oper":4,"event":2,"request":1,"sure":1,"follow":1,"argument":1,"platform":2,"screen":3,"thrown":1,"except":5,"support":4,"enabl":2,"opac":3,"transluc":13,"paint":4,"shape":6,"interim":1,"configur":2,"system":2,"visual":1,"frame":2,"disabl":1,"window":32,"will":3,"due":1,"make":2,"sub":1,"graphic":9,"pixel":14,"behavior":1,"link":8,"state":3,"exclud":1,"well":1,"affect":1,"consid":1,"mode":7,"opaqu":4,"met":2,"transpar":3,"indic":1,"graphicsdevic":1,"full":2,"alpha":15,"current":1,"dispatch":1,"valu":8,"dialog":2,"note":1,"less":5,"individu":1,"complet":1,"condit":2,"may":3,"locat":1,"depend":2,"capabl":1,"semi":1,"fulli":1,"equal":4,"illeg":3,"handl":1,"either":1,"per":4,"effect":1,"compon":8,"color":15,"undecor":5,"maynot":1,"background":12,"actual":1,"method":1,"devic":7,"chang":2,"also":1,"respect":1},"maxFreq":32,"totalTerms":302},"loc":32}
