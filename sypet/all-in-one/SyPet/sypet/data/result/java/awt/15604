If dynamic layout is currently inactive then Containers re-layout their components when resizing is completed. As a result the  {@code Component.validate()} method will be invoked onlyonce per resize. If dynamic layout is currently active then Containers re-layout their components on every native resize event and the  {@code validate()} method will be invoked each time.The OS/WM support can be queried using the getDesktopProperty(\"awt.dynamicLayoutSupported\") method.\n * @return    true if dynamic layout of Containers on resize iscurrently active, false otherwise.\n * @exception HeadlessException if the GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()method returns true\n * @see #setDynamicLayout(boolean dynamic)\n * @see #isDynamicLayoutSet()\n * @see #getDesktopProperty(String propertyName)\n * @see java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment#isHeadless\n * @since     1.4\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"otherwis":1,"fals":1,"result":1,"valid":2,"graphic":2,"desktop":2,"use":1,"activ":4,"inact":1,"whether":1,"resiz":5,"time":1,"iscurr":1,"oper":1,"event":1,"name":1,"layout":11,"current":3,"everi":1,"dynam":10,"complet":1,"except":2,"support":3,"manag":1,"invok":2,"environ":2,"true":2,"headless":3,"queri":1,"awt":2,"system":1,"window":1,"compon":3,"per":1,"program":1,"string":1,"contain":4,"will":2,"onlyonc":1,"java":1,"method":4,"properti":3},"maxFreq":11,"totalTerms":93},"loc":9}
