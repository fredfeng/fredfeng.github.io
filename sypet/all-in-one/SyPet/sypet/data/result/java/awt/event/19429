The extended key code is a unique id assigned to  a key on the keyboard just like  {@code keyCode}. However, unlike  {@code keyCode}, this value depends on the current keyboard layout. For instance, pressing the left topmost letter key in a common English layout produces the same value as  {@code keyCode},  {@code VK_Q}.
