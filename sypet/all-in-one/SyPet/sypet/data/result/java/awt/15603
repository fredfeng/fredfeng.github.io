Use  {@code isDynamicLayoutActive()} to detect if this feature enabledin this program and is supported by this operating system and/or window manager. Note that this feature is supported not on all platforms, and conversely, that this feature cannot be turned off on some platforms. On these platforms where dynamic layout during resizing is not supported (or is always supported), setting this property has no effect. Note that this feature can be set or unset as a property of the operating system or window manager on some platforms.  On such platforms, the dynamic resize property must be set at the operating system or window manager level before this method can take effect. This method does not change support or settings of the underlying operating system or window manager.  The OS/WM support can be queried using getDesktopProperty(\"awt.dynamicLayoutSupported\") method.\n * @param dynamic  If true, Containers should re-layout theircomponents as the Container is being resized.
