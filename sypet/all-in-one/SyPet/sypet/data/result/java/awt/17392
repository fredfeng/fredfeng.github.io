This \u003ccode\u003eAffineTransform\u003c/code\u003e is typically the Identity transform for most normal screens.  The default \u003ccode\u003eAffineTransform\u003c/code\u003e maps coordinates onto the device such that 72 user space coordinate units measure approximately 1 inch in device space.  The normalizing transform can be used to make this mapping more exact.  Coordinates in the coordinate space defined by the default \u003ccode\u003eAffineTransform\u003c/code\u003e for screen and printer devices have the origin in the upper left-hand corner of the target region of the device, with X coordinates increasing to the right and Y coordinates increasing downwards.
