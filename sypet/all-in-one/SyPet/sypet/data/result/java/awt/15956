No action will take place if this Window is not visible. Some platforms do not allow Windows which own other Windows to appear on top of those owned Windows. Some platforms may not permit this VM to place its Windows above windows of native applications, or Windows of other VMs. This permission may depend on whether a Window in this VM is already focused. Every attempt will be made to move this Window as high as possible in the stacking order; however, developers should not assume that this method will move this Window above all other windows in every situation. \u003cp\u003e Developers must never assume that this Window is the focused or active Window until this Window receives a WINDOW_GAINED_FOCUS or WINDOW_ACTIVATED event. On platforms where the top-most window is the focused window, this method will \u003cb\u003eprobably\u003c/b\u003e focus this Window (if it is not already focused) under the following conditions: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e The window meets the requirements outlined in the {@link #isFocusableWindow} method.\u003cli\u003e The window\u0027s property  {@code autoRequestFocus} is of the{@code true} value.\u003cli\u003e Native windowing system allows the window to get focused. \u003c/ul\u003e On platforms where the stacking order does not typically affect the focused window, this method will \u003cb\u003eprobably\u003c/b\u003e leave the focused and active Windows unchanged. \u003cp\u003e If this method causes this Window to be focused, and this Window is a Frame or a Dialog, it will also become activated. If this Window is focused, but it is not a Frame or a Dialog, then the first Frame or Dialog that is an owner of this Window will be activated. \u003cp\u003e If this window is blocked by modal dialog, then the blocking dialog is brought to the front and remains above the blocked window.\n * @see #toBack\n * @see #setAutoRequestFocus\n * @see #isFocusableWindow\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"appear":1,"outlin":1,"permit":1,"possibl":1,"show":1,"bring":1,"whether":1,"situat":1,"must":1,"becom":1,"requir":1,"probabl":2,"event":1,"request":2,"permiss":1,"action":1,"vms":1,"focus":15,"place":3,"howev":1,"everi":2,"move":2,"follow":1,"platform":4,"unchang":1,"meet":1,"system":1,"frame":3,"window":36,"owner":1,"leav":1,"will":7,"auto":2,"properti":1,"stack":3,"make":1,"attempt":1,"allow":2,"visibl":2,"link":1,"typic":1,"made":1,"block":3,"brought":1,"activ":4,"affect":1,"applic":1,"order":3,"valu":1,"develop":2,"dialog":5,"modal":1,"top":3,"condit":1,"may":3,"assum":2,"depend":1,"back":1,"true":1,"front":4,"receiv":1,"never":1,"caus":1,"remain":1,"take":1,"alreadi":2,"method":5,"high":1,"first":1,"also":1},"maxFreq":36,"totalTerms":166},"loc":3}
