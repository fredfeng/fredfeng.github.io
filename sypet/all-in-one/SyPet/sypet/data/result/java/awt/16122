{"id":16122,"className":"java.awt.Image","methodName":"flush","signature":"\u003cjava.awt.Image: void flush()\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Flushes all reconstructable resources being used by this Image object. This includes any pixel data that is being cached for rendering to the screen as well as any system resources that are being used to store data or pixels for the image if they can be recreated. The image is reset to a state similar to when it was first created so that if it is again rendered, the image data will have to be recreated or fetched again from its source. \u003cp\u003e Examples of how this method affects specific types of Image object: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e BufferedImage objects leave the primary Raster which stores their pixels untouched, but flush any information cached about those pixels such as copies uploaded to the display hardware for accelerated blits. \u003cli\u003e Image objects created by the Component methods which take a width and height leave their primary buffer of pixels untouched, but have all cached information released much like is done for BufferedImage objects. \u003cli\u003e VolatileImage objects release all of their pixel resources including their primary copy which is typically stored on the display hardware where resources are scarce. These objects can later be restored using their {@link java.awt.image.VolatileImage#validate validate}method. \u003cli\u003e Image objects created by the Toolkit and Component classes which are loaded from files, URLs or produced by an  {@link ImageProducer}are unloaded and all local resources are released. These objects can later be reloaded from their original source as needed when they are rendered, just as when they were first created. \u003c/ul\u003e\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"unload":1,"store":3,"type":1,"blit":1,"copi":2,"buffer":3,"height":1,"file":1,"reset":1,"fetch":1,"screen":1,"creat":4,"done":1,"width":1,"display":2,"imag":13,"like":1,"much":1,"render":3,"inform":2,"awt":1,"system":1,"acceler":1,"restor":1,"will":1,"leav":2,"load":1,"sourc":2,"scarc":1,"reload":1,"valid":2,"pixel":6,"link":2,"typic":1,"state":1,"data":3,"use":3,"well":1,"object":9,"affect":1,"upload":1,"resourc":5,"releas":3,"reconstruct":1,"toolkit":1,"recreat":2,"similar":1,"primari":3,"just":1,"includ":2,"later":2,"origin":1,"produc":2,"cach":3,"raster":1,"specif":1,"flush":3,"compon":2,"take":1,"exampl":1,"java":1,"method":3,"hardwar":2,"local":1,"first":2,"untouch":2},"maxFreq":13,"totalTerms":134},"loc":5}
