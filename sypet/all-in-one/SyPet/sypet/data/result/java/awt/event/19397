{"id":19397,"className":"java.awt.event.MouseEvent","methodName":"getButton","signature":"\u003cjava.awt.event.MouseEvent: int getButton()\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Returns which, if any, of the mouse buttons has changed state. The returned value is ranged from 0 to the  {@link java.awt.MouseInfo#getNumberOfButtons() MouseInfo.getNumberOfButtons()}value. The returned value includes at least the following constants: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e  {@code NOBUTTON}\u003cli\u003e  {@code BUTTON1}\u003cli\u003e  {@code BUTTON2}\u003cli\u003e  {@code BUTTON3}\u003c/ul\u003e It is allowed to use those constants to compare with the returned button number in the application. For example, \u003cpre\u003e if (anEvent.getButton() \u003d\u003d MouseEvent.BUTTON1) { \u003c/pre\u003e In particular, for a mouse with one, two, or three buttons this method may return the following values: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e 0 ( {@code NOBUTTON}) \u003cli\u003e 1 ( {@code BUTTON1}) \u003cli\u003e 2 ( {@code BUTTON2}) \u003cli\u003e 3 ( {@code BUTTON3}) \u003c/ul\u003e Button numbers greater then  {@code BUTTON3} have no constant identifier. So if a mouse with five buttons isinstalled, this method may return the following values: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e 0 ( {@code NOBUTTON}) \u003cli\u003e 1 ( {@code BUTTON1}) \u003cli\u003e 2 ( {@code BUTTON2}) \u003cli\u003e 3 ( {@code BUTTON3}) \u003cli\u003e 4 \u003cli\u003e 5 \u003c/ul\u003e \u003cp\u003e Note: If support for extended mouse buttons is  {@link Toolkit#areExtraMouseButtonsEnabled() disabled} by Javathen the AWT event subsystem does not produce mouse events for the extended mouse buttons. So it is not expected that this method returns anything except  {@code NOBUTTON},  {@code BUTTON1}, {@code BUTTON2},  {@code BUTTON3}.\n * @return one of the values from 0 to {@link java.awt.MouseInfo#getNumberOfButtons() MouseInfo.getNumberOfButtons()}if support for the extended mouse buttons is  {@link Toolkit#areExtraMouseButtonsEnabled() enabled} by Java.That range includes  {@code NOBUTTON},  {@code BUTTON1},  {@code BUTTON2},  {@code BUTTON3}; \u003cbr\u003e {@code NOBUTTON},  {@code BUTTON1},  {@code BUTTON2} or {@code BUTTON3}if support for the extended mouse buttons is  {@link Toolkit#areExtraMouseButtonsEnabled() disabled} by Java\n * @since 1.4\n * @see Toolkit#areExtraMouseButtonsEnabled()\n * @see java.awt.MouseInfo#getNumberOfButtons()\n * @see #MouseEvent(Component,int,long,int,int,int,int,int,int,boolean,int)\n * @see InputEvent#getMaskForButton(int)\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"anyth":1,"greater":1,"allow":1,"least":1,"link":5,"one":2,"state":1,"mask":1,"use":1,"particular":1,"identifi":1,"mous":19,"applic":1,"info":5,"expect":1,"button":21,"rang":2,"event":6,"three":1,"toolkit":4,"valu":6,"javathen":1,"note":1,"follow":3,"except":1,"may":2,"support":3,"five":1,"includ":2,"constant":3,"enabl":5,"extra":4,"isinstal":1,"produc":1,"number":7,"two":1,"input":1,"awt":3,"compon":1,"disabl":2,"pre":2,"exampl":1,"subsystem":1,"method":3,"java":5,"chang":1,"compar":1},"maxFreq":21,"totalTerms":139},"loc":3}
