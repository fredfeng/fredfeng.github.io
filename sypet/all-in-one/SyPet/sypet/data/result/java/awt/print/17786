The selected printer when the dialog is initially displayed will reflect the print service currently attached to this print job. If the user changes the print service, the PrinterJob will be updated to reflect this, unless the user cancels the dialog. As well as allowing the user to select the destination printer, the user can also select values of various print request attributes. \u003cp\u003e The attributes parameter on input will reflect the applications required initial selections in the user dialog. Attributes not specified display using the default for the service. On return it will reflect the user\u0027s choices. Selections may be updated by the implementation to be consistent with the supported values for the currently selected print service. \u003cp\u003e As the user scrolls to a new print service selection, the values copied are based on the settings for the previous service, together with any user changes. The values are not based on the original settings supplied by the client. \u003cp\u003e With the exception of selected printer, the PrinterJob state is not updated to reflect the user\u0027s changes. For the selections to affect a printer job, the attributes must be specified in the call to the \u003ccode\u003eprint(PrintRequestAttributeSet)\u003c/code\u003e method. If using the Pageable interface, clients which intend to use media selected by the user must create a PageFormat derived from the user\u0027s selections.
