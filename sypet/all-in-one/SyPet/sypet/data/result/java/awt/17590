Once focus enters a traversal cycle, typically it cannot leave it via focus traversal unless one of the up- or down-cycle keys is pressed. Normal traversal is limited to this Container, and all of this Container\u0027s descendants that are not descendants of inferior focus cycle roots. Note that a FocusTraversalPolicy may bend these restrictions, however. For example, ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy supports implicit down-cycle traversal.\n * @return whether this Container is the root of a focus traversal cycle\n * @see #setFocusCycleRoot\n * @see #setFocusTraversalPolicy\n * @see #getFocusTraversalPolicy\n * @see ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy\n * @since 1.4\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"press":1,"via":1,"root":5,"one":1,"normal":1,"inferior":1,"implicit":1,"typic":1,"cycl":8,"bend":1,"whether":2,"order":2,"unless":1,"focus":12,"howev":1,"key":1,"note":1,"travers":11,"limit":1,"may":1,"support":1,"enter":1,"polici":5,"restrict":1,"contain":6,"exampl":1,"leav":1,"descend":2},"maxFreq":12,"totalTerms":72},"loc":3}
