All coordinates rotate about the origin by the same amount. The amount of rotation is such that coordinates along the former positive X axis will subsequently align with the vector pointing from the origin to the specified vector coordinates. If both \u003ccode\u003evecx\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003evecy\u003c/code\u003e are 0.0, no additional rotation is added to this transform. This operation is equivalent to calling: \u003cpre\u003e rotate(Math.atan2(vecy, vecx)); \u003c/pre\u003e\n * @param vecx the X coordinate of the rotation vector\n * @param vecy the Y coordinate of the rotation vector\n * @since 1.6\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"call":1,"atan":1,"axi":1,"vecx":3,"former":1,"specifi":1,"amount":2,"transform":3,"oper":1,"equival":1,"vector":5,"along":1,"subsequ":1,"coordin":6,"addit":1,"concaten":1,"align":1,"origin":2,"rotat":9,"accord":1,"math":1,"point":1,"pre":2,"veci":3,"will":1,"ad":1,"posit":1},"maxFreq":9,"totalTerms":53},"loc":29}
