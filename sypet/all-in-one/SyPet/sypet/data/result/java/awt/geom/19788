Such segments could lie entirely within the interior of the path if they are part of a path with a  {@link #WIND_NON_ZERO}winding rule or if the segments are retraced in the reverse direction such that the two sets of segments cancel each other out without any exterior area falling between them. To determine whether segments represent true boundaries of the interior of the path would require extensive calculations involving all of the segments of the path and the winding rule and are thus beyond the scope of this implementation.\n * @since 1.6\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":1,"rectangular":1,"interior":3,"retrac":1,"scope":1,"exterior":2,"segment":7,"link":1,"cancel":1,"object":1,"whether":1,"beyond":1,"specifi":1,"revers":1,"requir":1,"area":2,"extens":1,"rule":2,"path":6,"direct":1,"wind":2,"may":1,"thus":1,"repres":2,"calcul":1,"conserv":1,"true":1,"involv":1,"without":1,"two":1,"determin":1,"fall":1,"intersect":1,"contain":1,"method":1,"within":1,"part":1,"boundari":2,"entir":1,"lie":1},"maxFreq":7,"totalTerms":59},"loc":20}
