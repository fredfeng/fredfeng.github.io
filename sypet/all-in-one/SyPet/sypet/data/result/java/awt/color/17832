For TYPE_XYZ spaces, this method returns minimum values of 0.0 for all components.  For TYPE_Lab spaces, this method returns 0.0 for L and -128.0 for a and b components. This is consistent with the encoding of the XYZ and Lab Profile Connection Spaces in the ICC specification.  For all other types, this method returns 0.0 for all components.  When using an ICC_ColorSpace with a profile that requires different minimum component values, it is necessary to subclass this class and override this method.\n * @param component The component index.\n * @return The minimum normalized component value.\n * @throws IllegalArgumentException if component is less than 0 orgreater than numComponents - 1.\n * @since 1.4\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"connect":1,"minimum":4,"normal":2,"use":1,"space":4,"type":1,"lab":2,"necessari":1,"specifi":1,"requir":1,"orgreat":1,"valu":5,"less":1,"profil":2,"min":1,"argument":1,"except":1,"index":1,"consist":1,"illeg":1,"differ":1,"num":1,"encod":1,"specif":1,"compon":11,"color":2,"subclass":1,"method":4},"maxFreq":11,"totalTerms":55},"loc":7}
