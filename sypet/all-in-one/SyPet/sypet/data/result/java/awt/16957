{"id":16957,"className":"java.awt.Component","methodName":"requestFocusInWindow","signature":"\u003cjava.awt.Component: boolean requestFocusInWindow()\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Requests that this Component get the input focus, if this Component\u0027s top-level ancestor is already the focused Window. This component must be displayable, focusable, visible and all of its ancestors (with the exception of the top-level Window) must be visible for the request to be granted. Every effort will be made to honor the request; however, in some cases it may be impossible to do so. Developers must never assume that this Component is the focus owner until this Component receives a FOCUS_GAINED event. \u003cp\u003e This method returns a boolean value. If \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e is returned, the request is \u003cb\u003eguaranteed to fail\u003c/b\u003e. If \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e is returned, the request will succeed \u003cb\u003eunless\u003c/b\u003e it is vetoed, or an extraordinary event, such as disposal of the Component\u0027s peer, occurs before the request can be granted by the native windowing system. Again, while a return value of \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e indicates that the request is likely to succeed, developers must never assume that this Component is the focus owner until this Component receives a FOCUS_GAINED event. \u003cp\u003e This method cannot be used to set the focus owner to no Component at all. Use \u003ccode\u003eKeyboardFocusManager.clearGlobalFocusOwner()\u003c/code\u003e instead. \u003cp\u003e The focus behavior of this method can be implemented uniformly across platforms, and thus developers are strongly encouraged to use this method over \u003ccode\u003erequestFocus\u003c/code\u003e when possible. Code which relies on \u003ccode\u003erequestFocus\u003c/code\u003e may exhibit different focus behavior on different platforms. \u003cp\u003eNote: Not all focus transfers result from invoking this method. As such, a component may receive focus without this or any of the other {@code requestFocus} methods of {@code Component} being invoked.\n * @return \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e if the focus change request is guaranteed tofail; \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e if it is likely to succeed\n * @see #requestFocus\n * @see java.awt.event.FocusEvent\n * @see #addFocusListener\n * @see #isFocusable\n * @see #isDisplayable\n * @see KeyboardFocusManager#clearGlobalFocusOwner\n * @since 1.4\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":2,"grant":2,"possibl":1,"must":4,"reli":1,"level":2,"fail":1,"event":5,"encourag":1,"request":13,"focus":23,"howev":1,"everi":1,"platform":2,"transfer":1,"except":1,"succeed":3,"honor":1,"invok":2,"veto":1,"global":2,"effort":1,"display":2,"like":2,"without":1,"awt":1,"input":1,"system":1,"tofail":1,"window":4,"strong":1,"will":2,"owner":5,"result":1,"behavior":2,"visibl":2,"made":1,"use":3,"add":1,"across":1,"clear":2,"unless":1,"indic":1,"valu":2,"develop":3,"listen":1,"ancestor":2,"note":1,"top":2,"peer":1,"may":3,"keyboard":2,"assum":2,"thus":1,"uniform":1,"guarante":2,"manag":2,"true":3,"receiv":3,"exhibit":1,"differ":2,"never":2,"compon":11,"instead":1,"dispos":1,"java":1,"imposs":1,"alreadi":1,"method":6,"chang":1,"extraordinari":1,"occur":1},"maxFreq":23,"totalTerms":168},"loc":3}
