The default implementation ignores the attribute set. \u003cp\u003e Note that some attributes may be set directly on the PrinterJob by equivalent method calls, (for example), copies: \u003ccode\u003esetcopies(int)\u003c/code\u003e, job name: \u003ccode\u003esetJobName(String)\u003c/code\u003e and specifying media size and orientation though the \u003ccode\u003ePageFormat\u003c/code\u003e object. \u003cp\u003e If a supported attribute-value is specified in this attribute set, it will take precedence over the API settings for this print() operation only. The following behaviour is specified for PageFormat: If a client uses the Printable interface, then the \u003ccode\u003eattributes\u003c/code\u003e parameter to this method is examined for attributes which specify media (by size), orientation, and imageable area, and those are used to construct a new PageFormat which is passed to the Printable object\u0027s print() method. See  {@link Printable} for an explanation of the requiredbehaviour of a Printable to ensure optimal printing via PrinterJob. For clients of the Pageable interface, the PageFormat will always be as supplied by that interface, on a per page basis. \u003cp\u003e These behaviours allow an application to directly pass the user settings returned from \u003ccode\u003eprintDialog(PrintRequestAttributeSet attributes\u003c/code\u003e to this print() method. \u003cp\u003e\n * @param attributes a set of attributes for the job\n * @exception PrinterException an error in the print systemcaused the job to be aborted.\n * @see Book\n * @see Pageable\n * @see Printable\n * @since 1.4\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"via":1,"client":2,"though":1,"copi":1,"specifi":4,"page":6,"equival":1,"oper":1,"request":1,"examin":1,"follow":1,"except":2,"ignor":1,"support":1,"alway":1,"job":6,"format":4,"imag":1,"requiredbehaviour":1,"size":2,"will":2,"media":2,"call":1,"allow":1,"behaviour":2,"link":1,"setcopi":1,"use":3,"object":2,"applic":1,"ensur":1,"attribut":11,"area":1,"name":2,"valu":1,"pageabl":2,"dialog":1,"note":1,"direct":2,"systemcaus":1,"may":1,"error":1,"optim":1,"paramet":1,"suppli":1,"print":9,"printer":3,"printabl":5,"pass":2,"preced":1,"orient":2,"per":1,"take":1,"string":1,"book":1,"exampl":1,"method":4,"construct":1,"basi":1,"user":1,"explan":1,"abort":1},"maxFreq":11,"totalTerms":119},"loc":3}
