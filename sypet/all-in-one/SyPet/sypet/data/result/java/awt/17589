Once focus enters a traversal cycle, typically it cannot leave it via focus traversal unless one of the up- or down-cycle keys is pressed. Normal traversal is limited to this Container, and all of this Container\u0027s descendants that are not descendants of inferior focus cycle roots. Note that a FocusTraversalPolicy may bend these restrictions, however. For example, ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy supports implicit down-cycle traversal. \u003cp\u003e The alternative way to specify the traversal order of this Container\u0027s children is to make this Container a \u003ca href\u003d\"doc-files/FocusSpec.html#FocusTraversalPolicyProviders\"\u003efocus traversal policy provider\u003c/a\u003e.\n * @param focusCycleRoot indicates whether this Container is the root of afocus traversal cycle\n * @see #isFocusCycleRoot()\n * @see #setFocusTraversalPolicy\n * @see #getFocusTraversalPolicy\n * @see ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy\n * @see #setFocusTraversalPolicyProvider\n * @since 1.4\n * @beaninfo bound: true\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"spec":1,"press":1,"via":1,"beaninfo":1,"root":6,"one":1,"normal":1,"inferior":1,"implicit":1,"typic":1,"cycl":9,"bend":1,"children":1,"way":1,"whether":2,"specifi":1,"afocus":1,"indic":1,"altern":1,"order":3,"unless":1,"file":1,"focus":16,"howev":1,"href":1,"key":1,"note":1,"travers":15,"limit":1,"may":1,"support":1,"true":1,"enter":1,"polici":8,"provid":3,"restrict":1,"contain":8,"exampl":1,"leav":1,"html":1,"descend":2,"make":1,"bound":1},"maxFreq":16,"totalTerms":105},"loc":9}
