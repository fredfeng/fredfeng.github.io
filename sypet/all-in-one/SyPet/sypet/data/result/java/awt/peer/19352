The number of the screen device is only returned for independent devices (which are not parts of a virtual screen device). For virtual screen devices, 0 is returned. Mouse coordinates are also calculated depending on whether or not the screen device is virtual. For virtual screen devices, pointer coordinates are calculated in the virtual coordinate system. Otherwise, coordinates are calculated in the coordinate system of the screen device where the pointer is located. See java.awt.GraphicsConfiguration documentation for more details about virtual screen devices.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"otherwis":1,"virtual":6,"detail":1,"graphic":1,"cursor":1,"mous":2,"whether":1,"coord":1,"document":1,"independ":1,"current":1,"coordin":6,"screen":8,"locat":2,"depend":1,"fill":2,"calcul":3,"number":2,"field":1,"two":1,"point":2,"configur":1,"awt":1,"system":2,"pointer":3,"java":1,"method":1,"devic":9,"part":1,"also":1,"thing":1},"maxFreq":9,"totalTerms":66},"loc":0}
