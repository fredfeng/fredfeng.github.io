For image data supported by the Java 2D API, this will be one of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_INT, DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT, or DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE.  Data in the array may be in a packed format, thus increasing efficiency for data transfers. An ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException may be thrown if the coordinates are not in bounds, or if inData is not large enough to hold the pixel data. However, explicit bounds checking is not guaranteed.
