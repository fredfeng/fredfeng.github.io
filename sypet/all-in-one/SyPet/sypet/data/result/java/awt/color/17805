If the profile has specified the TRC as linear (gamma \u003d 1.0) or as a simple gamma value, this method throws an exception, and the getGamma() method should be used to get the gamma value.  Otherwise the short array returned here represents a lookup table where the input Gray value is conceptually in the range [0.0, 1.0].  Value 0.0 maps to array index 0 and value 1.0 maps to array index length-1. Interpolation may be used to generate output values for input values which do not map exactly to an index in the array.  Output values also map linearly to the range [0.0, 1.0]. Value 0.0 is represented by an array value of 0x0000 and value 1.0 by 0xFFFF, i.e. the values are really unsigned short values, although they are returned in a short array.\n * @return a short array representing the TRC.\n * @exception ProfileDataException if the profile does not specifythe TRC as a table.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"otherwis":1,"realli":1,"simpl":1,"data":1,"use":2,"lookup":1,"specifi":1,"although":1,"gamma":4,"rang":2,"exact":1,"interpol":1,"map":4,"length":1,"valu":13,"profil":3,"except":3,"linear":2,"index":3,"may":1,"repres":3,"conceptu":1,"gray":1,"input":2,"unsign":1,"tabl":2,"generat":1,"method":2,"specifyth":1,"output":2,"also":1,"array":8},"maxFreq":13,"totalTerms":72},"loc":6}
