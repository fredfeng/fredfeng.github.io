If the default implementation of \u003ccode\u003echeckPrintJobAccess\u003c/code\u003e is used (that is, that method is not overriden), then this results in a call to the security manager\u0027s \u003ccode\u003echeckPermission\u003c/code\u003e method with a \u003ccode\u003e RuntimePermission(\"queuePrintJob\")\u003c/code\u003e permission.\n * @param frame the parent of the print dialog.
