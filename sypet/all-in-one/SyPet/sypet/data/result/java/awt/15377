A created font is one that was returned from calling {@link Font#createFont}, or derived from a created font by calling  {@link Font#deriveFont}. After calling this method for such a font, it is available to be used in constructing new \u003ccode\u003eFont\u003c/code\u003es by name or family name, and is enumerated by  {@link #getAvailableFontFamilyNames} and{@link #getAllFonts} within the execution context of thisapplication or applet. This means applets cannot register fonts in a way that they are visible to other applets. \u003cp\u003e Reasons that this method might not register the font and therefore return \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e are: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003eThe font is not a \u003ci\u003ecreated\u003c/i\u003e \u003ccode\u003eFont\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cli\u003eThe font conflicts with a non-created \u003ccode\u003eFont\u003c/code\u003e already in this \u003ccode\u003eGraphicsEnvironment\u003c/code\u003e. For example if the name is that of a system font, or a logical font as described in the documentation of the  {@link Font} class. It is implementation dependentwhether a font may also conflict if it has the same family name as a system font. \u003cp\u003eNotice that an application can supersede the registration of an earlier created font with a new one. \u003c/ul\u003e\n * @return true if the \u003ccode\u003efont\u003c/code\u003e is successfullyregistered in this \u003ccode\u003eGraphicsEnvironment\u003c/code\u003e.\n * @throws NullPointerException if \u003ccode\u003efont\u003c/code\u003e is null\n * @since 1.6\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":1,"might":1,"call":3,"graphic":3,"deriv":2,"reason":1,"visibl":1,"link":5,"one":2,"supersed":1,"use":1,"way":1,"therefor":1,"notic":1,"applic":1,"document":1,"name":5,"dependentwheth":1,"regist":4,"applet":3,"mean":1,"except":1,"may":1,"creat":7,"famili":3,"font":26,"environ":3,"true":1,"describ":1,"avail":2,"registr":1,"successfullyregist":1,"logic":1,"non":1,"thisappl":1,"system":2,"earlier":1,"exampl":1,"context":1,"pointer":1,"alreadi":1,"conflict":2,"method":2,"construct":1,"within":1,"execut":1,"also":1},"maxFreq":26,"totalTerms":105},"loc":7}
