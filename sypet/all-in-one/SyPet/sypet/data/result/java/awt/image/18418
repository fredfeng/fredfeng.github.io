When pixels are transferred via these methods, they may be transferred in a packed or unpacked format, depending on the implementation of the underlying SampleModel.  Using these methods, pixels are transferred as an array of getNumDataElements() elements of a primitive type given by getTransferType().  The TransferType may or may not be the same as the storage data type of the DataBuffer.  The TransferType will be one of the types defined in DataBuffer.\n * @return this transfer type.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"unpack":1,"defin":1,"primit":1,"element":4,"model":1,"transfer":10,"may":3,"via":2,"pixel":3,"depend":1,"one":1,"data":6,"use":2,"pack":1,"format":1,"storag":1,"type":9,"buffer":2,"num":1,"given":1,"will":1,"method":3,"sampl":1,"array":1},"maxFreq":10,"totalTerms":58},"loc":3}
