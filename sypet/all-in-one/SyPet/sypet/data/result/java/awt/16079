Transparent pixels do not affect whatever pixels are already there. \u003cp\u003e This method returns immediately in all cases, even if the image area to be drawn has not yet been scaled, dithered, and converted for the current output device. If the current output representation is not yet complete then \u003ccode\u003edrawImage\u003c/code\u003e returns \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e. As more of the image becomes available, the process that loads the image notifies the specified image observer. \u003cp\u003e This method always uses the unscaled version of the image to render the scaled rectangle and performs the required scaling on the fly. It does not use a cached, scaled version of the image for this operation. Scaling of the image from source to destination is performed such that the first coordinate of the source rectangle is mapped to the first coordinate of the destination rectangle, and the second source coordinate is mapped to the second destination coordinate. The subimage is scaled and flipped as needed to preserve those mappings.\n * @param img the specified image to be drawn.
