Note however that events are passed on to the input method regardless whether it is enabled or not, and that an input method that is disabled for composition may still interpret events for control purposes, including to enable or disable itself for composition. \u003cp\u003e For input methods provided by host operating systems, it is not always possible to determine whether this operation is supported. For example, an input method may enable composition only for some locales, and do nothing for other locales. For such input methods, it is possible that this method does not throw {@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException UnsupportedOperationException}, but also does not affect whether composition is enabled. \u003cp\u003e This method is called \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003eby  {@link java.awt.im.InputContext#setCompositionEnabled InputContext.setCompositionEnabled}, \u003cli\u003ewhen switching to this input method from a different one using the user interface or {@link java.awt.im.InputContext#selectInputMethod InputContext.selectInputMethod}, if the previously selected input method\u0027s {@link java.awt.im.spi.InputMethod#isCompositionEnabled isCompositionEnabled}method returns without throwing an exception. \u003c/ul\u003e\n * @param enable whether to enable the input method for composition\n * @throws UnsupportedOperationException if this input method does notsupport the enabling/disabling operation\n * @see #isCompositionEnabled\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"unsupport":3,"possibl":2,"whether":4,"oper":6,"event":4,"spi":1,"purpos":2,"howev":1,"control":2,"except":4,"host":1,"support":1,"composit":15,"enabl":16,"alway":1,"select":3,"without":1,"provid":1,"input":19,"system":1,"awt":3,"disabl":5,"determin":1,"incom":1,"call":1,"link":4,"one":1,"interpret":3,"use":1,"lang":1,"affect":1,"noth":1,"valu":1,"note":1,"regardless":1,"may":2,"includ":1,"previous":1,"depend":1,"paramet":1,"still":1,"notsupport":1,"pass":1,"differ":1,"exampl":1,"context":4,"method":18,"java":4,"local":2,"also":1,"user":1},"maxFreq":19,"totalTerms":155},"loc":0}
