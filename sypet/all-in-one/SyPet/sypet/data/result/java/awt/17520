Note that a limit on the accuracy of the flattened path might be silently imposed, causing very small flattening parameters to be treated as larger values.  This limit, if there is one, is defined by the particular implementation that is used. \u003cp\u003e Each call to this method returns a fresh \u003ccode\u003ePathIterator\u003c/code\u003e object that traverses the \u003ccode\u003eShape\u003c/code\u003e object geometry independently from any other \u003ccode\u003ePathIterator\u003c/code\u003e objects in use at the same time. \u003cp\u003e It is recommended, but not guaranteed, that objects implementing the \u003ccode\u003eShape\u003c/code\u003e interface isolate iterations that are in process from any changes that might occur to the original object\u0027s geometry during such iterations.\n * @param at an optional \u003ccode\u003eAffineTransform\u003c/code\u003e to be applied to thecoordinates as they are returned in the iteration, or \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e if untransformed coordinates are desired\n * @param flatness the maximum distance that the line segments used toapproximate the curved segments are allowed to deviate from any point on the original curve\n * @return a new \u003ccode\u003ePathIterator\u003c/code\u003e that independently traversesa flattened view of the geometry of the  \u003ccode\u003eShape\u003c/code\u003e.\n * @since 1.2\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"outlin":1,"segment":4,"particular":1,"desir":1,"type":1,"deviat":2,"specifi":2,"amount":1,"time":1,"independ":2,"thecoordin":1,"along":1,"curv":4,"option":2,"coordin":2,"limit":2,"control":1,"flat":2,"traversesa":1,"shape":5,"provid":1,"appli":1,"unflatten":1,"maximum":2,"distanc":2,"view":2,"boundari":1,"small":1,"geometri":4,"treat":1,"silent":1,"might":2,"defin":1,"call":1,"allow":1,"one":1,"toapproxim":1,"line":1,"untransform":1,"use":3,"object":6,"recommend":1,"transform":4,"flatten":5,"fresh":1,"path":6,"valu":1,"isol":1,"note":1,"travers":1,"guarante":1,"larger":1,"origin":2,"paramet":2,"accord":1,"access":1,"accuraci":1,"impos":1,"process":1,"point":3,"caus":1,"subdivis":1,"method":1,"chang":1,"iter":11,"occur":1,"affin":2},"maxFreq":11,"totalTerms":125},"loc":0}
