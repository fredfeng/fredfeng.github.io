Typical usage would be to allow a user to select a particular font.  Then, the application can size the font and set various font attributes by calling the \u003ccode\u003ederiveFont\u003c/code\u003e method on the choosen instance. \u003cp\u003e This method provides for the application the most precise control over which \u003ccode\u003eFont\u003c/code\u003e instance is used to render text.
