For image data supported by the Java 2D API, this will be one of DataBuffer.TYPE_BYTE, DataBuffer.TYPE_USHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_INT, DataBuffer.TYPE_SHORT, DataBuffer.TYPE_FLOAT, or DataBuffer.TYPE_DOUBLE.  Data may be returned in a packed format, thus increasing efficiency for data transfers. Generally, obj should be passed in as null, so that the Object will be created automatically and will be of the right primitive data type. \u003cp\u003e The following code illustrates transferring data for a rectangular region of pixels from DataBuffer \u003ccode\u003edb1\u003c/code\u003e, whose storage layout is described by SampleModel \u003ccode\u003esm1\u003c/code\u003e, to DataBuffer \u003ccode\u003edb2\u003c/code\u003e, whose storage layout is described by SampleModel \u003ccode\u003esm2\u003c/code\u003e.
