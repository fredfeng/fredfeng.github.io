(Note, however, that \u003ccode\u003eScrollPane\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003eJScrollPane\u003c/code\u003e already have this functionality built in.) \u003cP\u003e This method returns the number of units to scroll when scroll type is MouseWheelEvent.WHEEL_UNIT_SCROLL, and should only be called if \u003ccode\u003egetScrollType\u003c/code\u003e returns MouseWheelEvent.WHEEL_UNIT_SCROLL. \u003cP\u003e Direction of scroll, amount of wheel movement, and platform settings for wheel scrolling are all accounted for. This method does not and cannot take into account value of the Adjustable/Scrollable unit increment, as this will vary among scrolling components. \u003cP\u003e A simplified example of how this method might be used in a listener: \u003cpre\u003e mouseWheelMoved(MouseWheelEvent event) { ScrollPane sp \u003d getScrollPaneFromSomewhere(); Adjustable adj \u003d sp.getVAdjustable() if (MouseWheelEvent.getScrollType() \u003d\u003d WHEEL_UNIT_SCROLL) { int totalScrollAmount \u003d event.getUnitsToScroll()  adj.getUnitIncrement(); adj.setValue(adj.getValue() + totalScrollAmount); } } \u003c/pre\u003e\n * @return the number of units to scroll based on the direction and amountof mouse wheel rotation, and on the wheel scrolling settings of the native platform\n * @see #getScrollType\n * @see #getScrollAmount\n * @see MouseWheelListener\n * @see java.awt.Adjustable\n * @see java.awt.Adjustable#getUnitIncrement\n * @see javax.swing.Scrollable\n * @see javax.swing.Scrollable#getScrollableUnitIncrement\n * @see java.awt.ScrollPane\n * @see java.awt.ScrollPane#setWheelScrollingEnabled\n * @see javax.swing.JScrollPane\n * @see javax.swing.JScrollPane#setWheelScrollingEnabled\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"total":2,"type":4,"mous":8,"function":1,"amount":5,"javax":4,"event":6,"among":1,"movement":1,"swing":4,"howev":1,"jscroll":4,"move":1,"platform":3,"increment":4,"scroll":24,"enabl":2,"rotat":1,"number":2,"simplifi":1,"awt":4,"will":1,"vari":1,"call":1,"might":1,"scrollabl":4,"wheel":13,"common":1,"use":1,"somewher":1,"adj":4,"aid":1,"vadjust":1,"adjust":4,"valu":3,"built":1,"listen":3,"note":1,"conveni":1,"direct":2,"pane":10,"unit":8,"compon":1,"conform":1,"take":1,"pre":2,"exampl":1,"base":1,"amountof":1,"account":2,"java":4,"alreadi":1,"method":4},"maxFreq":24,"totalTerms":165},"loc":3}
