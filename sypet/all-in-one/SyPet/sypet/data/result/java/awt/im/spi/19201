If input method support is enabled for the focussed component, incoming events of certain types are dispatched to the current input method for this component before they are dispatched to the component\u0027s methods or event listeners.

If it does, it also calls the event\u0027s \u003ccode\u003econsume\u003c/code\u003e method; this causes the event to not get dispatched to the component\u0027s event processing methods or event listeners. \u003cp\u003e Events are dispatched if they are instances of InputEvent or its subclasses.
