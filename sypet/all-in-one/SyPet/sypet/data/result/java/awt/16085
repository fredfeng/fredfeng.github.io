The coordinates of the specified rectangular area are in the user coordinate space and are relative to the coordinate system origin of this graphics context. This method may use an algorithm that calculates a result quickly but which sometimes might return true even if the specified rectangular area does not intersect the clipping area. The specific algorithm employed may thus trade off accuracy for speed, but it will never return false unless it can guarantee that the specified rectangular area does not intersect the current clipping area. The clipping area used by this method can represent the intersection of the user clip as specified through the clip methods of this graphics context as well as the clipping associated with the device or image bounds and window visibility.\n * @param x the x coordinate of the rectangle to test against the clip\n * @param y the y coordinate of the rectangle to test against the clip\n * @param width the width of the rectangle to test against the clip\n * @param height the height of the rectangle to test against the clip\n * @return \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e if the specified rectangle intersectsthe bounds of the current clip; \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e otherwise.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":2,"rectangular":4,"test":4,"specifi":6,"intersectsth":1,"height":2,"hit":1,"relat":1,"coordin":5,"calcul":1,"width":2,"imag":1,"system":1,"window":1,"intersect":4,"will":1,"even":1,"otherwis":1,"result":1,"might":2,"graphic":2,"trade":1,"visibl":1,"quick":1,"use":2,"well":1,"space":1,"rectangl":5,"algorithm":2,"area":8,"unless":1,"associ":1,"current":3,"sometim":1,"clip":13,"may":2,"thus":1,"speed":1,"repres":1,"guarante":1,"origin":1,"true":3,"accuraci":1,"employ":1,"specif":1,"never":1,"context":2,"method":3,"devic":1,"user":2,"bound":2},"maxFreq":13,"totalTerms":109},"loc":10}
