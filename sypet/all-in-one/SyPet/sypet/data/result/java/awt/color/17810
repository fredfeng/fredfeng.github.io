Relative file names are looked for in several places: first, relative to any directories specified by the java.iccprofile.path property; second, relative to any directories specified by the java.class.path property; finally, in a directory used to store profiles always available, such as the profile for sRGB.  Built-in profiles use .pf as the file name extension for profiles, e.g. sRGB.pf.
