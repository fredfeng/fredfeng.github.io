This means that the XYZ argument values taken by this method are represented relative to the D50 white point of the CS_CIEXYZ color space. This representation is useful in a two-step color conversion process in which colors are transformed from an input color space to CS_CIEXYZ and then to an output color space.  The color values returned by this method are not those that would produce the XYZ value passed to the method when measured by a colorimeter. If you have XYZ values corresponding to measurements made using current CIE recommended practices, they must be converted to D50 relative values before being passed to this method. The paragraphs below explain this in more detail. \u003cp\u003e The ICC standard uses a device independent color space (DICS) as the mechanism for converting color from one device to another device.  In this architecture, colors are converted from the source device\u0027s color space to the ICC DICS and then from the ICC DICS to the destination device\u0027s color space.  The ICC standard defines device profiles which contain transforms which will convert between a device\u0027s color space and the ICC DICS.  The overall conversion of colors from a source device to colors of a destination device is done by connecting the device-to-DICS transform of the profile for the source device to the DICS-to-device transform of the profile for the destination device. For this reason, the ICC DICS is commonly referred to as the profile connection space (PCS).  The color space used in the methods toCIEXYZ and fromCIEXYZ is the CIEXYZ PCS defined by the ICC Specification.  This is also the color space represented by ColorSpace.CS_CIEXYZ. \u003cp\u003e The XYZ values of a color are often represented as relative to some white point, so the actual meaning of the XYZ values cannot be known without knowing the white point of those values.  This is known as relative colorimetry.  The PCS uses a white point of D50, so the XYZ values of the PCS are relative to D50.  For example, white in the PCS will have the XYZ values of D50, which is defined to be X\u003d.9642, Y\u003d1.000, and Z\u003d0.8249.  This white point is commonly used for graphic arts applications, but others are often used in other applications. \u003cp\u003e To quantify the color characteristics of a device such as a printer or monitor, measurements of XYZ values for particular device colors are typically made.  For purposes of this discussion, the term device XYZ values is used to mean the XYZ values that would be measured from device colors using current CIE recommended practices. \u003cp\u003e Converting between device XYZ values and the PCS XYZ values taken as arguments by this method corresponds to converting between the device\u0027s color space, as represented by CIE colorimetric values, and the PCS. There are many factors involved in this process, some of which are quite subtle.  The most important, however, is the adjustment made to account for differences between the device\u0027s white point and the white point of the PCS.  There are many techniques for doing this and it is the subject of much current research and controversy.  Some commonly used methods are XYZ scaling, the von Kries transform, and the Bradford transform.  The proper method to use depends upon each particular application. \u003cp\u003e The simplest method is XYZ scaling.  In this method each device XYZ value is  converted to a PCS XYZ value by multiplying it by the ratio of the PCS white point (D50) to the device white point. \u003cpre\u003e Xd, Yd, Zd are the device XYZ values Xdw, Ydw, Zdw are the device XYZ white point values Xp, Yp, Zp are the PCS XYZ values Xd50, Yd50, Zd50 are the PCS XYZ white point values Xp \u003d Xd * (Xd50 / Xdw) Yp \u003d Yd * (Yd50 / Ydw) Zp \u003d Zd * (Zd50 / Zdw) \u003c/pre\u003e \u003cp\u003e Conversion from the PCS to the device would be done by inverting these equations: \u003cpre\u003e Xd \u003d Xp * (Xdw / Xd50) Yd \u003d Yp * (Ydw / Yd50) Zd \u003d Zp * (Zdw / Zd50) \u003c/pre\u003e \u003cp\u003e Note that the media white point tag in an ICC profile is not the same as the device white point.  The media white point tag is expressed in PCS values and is used to represent the difference between the XYZ of device illuminant and the XYZ of the device media when measured under that illuminant.  The device white point is expressed as the device XYZ values corresponding to white displayed on the device.  For example, displaying the RGB color (1.0, 1.0, 1.0) on an sRGB device will result in a measured device XYZ value of D65.  This will not be the same as the media white point tag XYZ value in the ICC profile for an sRGB device. \u003cp\u003e \u003cp\u003e\n * @param colorvalue a float array with length of at least 3.\n * @return a float array with length equal to the number ofcomponents in this ColorSpace.\n * @throws ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if array length is notat least 3.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"paragraph":1,"reason":1,"tag":3,"colorimetri":2,"particular":2,"refer":1,"relat":6,"purpos":1,"mani":2,"done":2,"art":1,"number":1,"involv":1,"without":1,"quantifi":1,"ratio":1,"discuss":1,"will":4,"sourc":3,"kri":1,"explain":1,"array":4,"upon":1,"graphic":1,"colorvalu":1,"common":3,"correspond":3,"subject":1,"made":3,"typic":1,"use":13,"anoth":1,"express":2,"space":15,"quit":1,"applic":3,"invert":1,"transform":8,"zdw":3,"length":3,"practic":2,"current":3,"adjust":1,"ydw":3,"note":1,"assum":1,"repres":5,"factor":1,"research":1,"printer":1,"represent":1,"techniqu":1,"process":2,"point":16,"differ":2,"mechan":1,"xdw":3,"exampl":2,"account":1,"method":11,"bound":1,"destin":3,"detail":1,"least":2,"simplest":1,"subtl":1,"must":1,"independ":1,"colorimet":1,"bradford":1,"taken":2,"proper":1,"howev":1,"profil":6,"illumin":2,"argument":2,"except":1,"index":1,"monitor":1,"white":18,"display":2,"much":1,"input":1,"often":2,"contain":1,"known":2,"output":1,"media":4,"characterist":1,"result":1,"defin":4,"scale":2,"connect":2,"controversi":1,"one":1,"colorimetr":1,"convers":4,"convert":7,"recommend":2,"von":1,"multipli":1,"mean":3,"valu":28,"equat":1,"standard":2,"ofcompon":1,"depend":1,"equal":1,"produc":1,"know":1,"pass":2,"two":1,"notat":1,"specif":2,"architectur":1,"color":28,"term":1,"pre":4,"actual":1,"measur":6,"devic":34,"also":1,"step":1},"maxFreq":34,"totalTerms":376},"loc":39}
