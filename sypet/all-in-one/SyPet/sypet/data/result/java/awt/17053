{"id":17053,"className":"java.awt.KeyEventPostProcessor","methodName":"postProcessKeyEvent","signature":"\u003cjava.awt.KeyEventPostProcessor: boolean postProcessKeyEvent(java.awt.event.KeyEvent)\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * This method is called by the current KeyboardFocusManager, requesting that this KeyEventPostProcessor perform any necessary post-processing which should be part of the KeyEvent\u0027s final resolution. At the time this method is invoked, typically the KeyEvent has already been dispatched to and handled by its target. However, if no Component in the application currently owns the focus, then the KeyEvent has not been dispatched to any Component. Typically, KeyEvent post-processing will be used to implement features which require global KeyEvent post-handling, such as menu shortcuts. Note that if a KeyEventPostProcessor wishes to dispatch the KeyEvent, it must use \u003ccode\u003eredispatchEvent\u003c/code\u003e to prevent the AWT from recursively requesting that this KeyEventPostProcessor perform post-processing of the event again. \u003cp\u003e If an implementation of this method returns \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e, then the KeyEvent is passed to the next KeyEventPostProcessor in the chain, ending with the current KeyboardFocusManager. If an implementation returns \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e, the KeyEvent is assumed to have been fully handled (although this need not be the case), and the AWT will take no further action with regard to the KeyEvent. If an implementation consumes the KeyEvent but returns \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e, the consumed event will still be passed to the next KeyEventPostProcessor in the chain. It is important for developers to check whether the KeyEvent has been consumed before performing any post-processing of the KeyEvent. By default, the current KeyboardFocusManager will perform no post- processing in response to a consumed KeyEvent.\n * @param e the KeyEvent to post-process\n * @return \u003ccode\u003etrue\u003c/code\u003e if the AWT should take no further action withregard to the KeyEvent; \u003ccode\u003efalse\u003c/code\u003e otherwise\n * @see KeyboardFocusManager#redispatchEvent\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"fals":3,"wish":1,"perform":4,"necessari":1,"whether":1,"must":1,"withregard":1,"time":1,"although":1,"requir":1,"event":25,"request":2,"action":2,"focus":5,"howev":1,"processor":5,"key":21,"respons":1,"invok":1,"global":1,"menu":1,"regard":1,"prevent":1,"will":4,"recurs":1,"redispatch":2,"otherwis":1,"call":1,"next":2,"typic":2,"use":2,"applic":1,"shortcut":1,"consum":4,"resolut":1,"current":4,"dispatch":3,"develop":1,"note":1,"end":1,"keyboard":4,"post":13,"assum":1,"check":1,"manag":4,"true":2,"still":1,"fulli":1,"handl":3,"pass":2,"process":7,"compon":2,"chain":2,"take":2,"target":1,"featur":1,"alreadi":1,"method":3,"part":1},"maxFreq":25,"totalTerms":167},"loc":0}
