Some images are created or cached in accelerated memory on a first-come, first-served basis.  On some operating systems, this memory is a finite resource.  Calling this method and scheduling the creation and flushing of images carefully may enable applications to make the most efficient use of that finite resource. \u003cbr\u003e Note that the number returned is a snapshot of how much memory is available; some images may still have problems being allocated into that memory.  For example, depending on operating system, driver, memory configuration, and thread situations, the full extent of the size reported may not be available for a given image.  There are further inquiry methods on the  {@link ImageCapabilities} objectassociated with a VolatileImage that can be used to determine whether a particular VolatileImage has been created in accelerated memory.\n * @return number of bytes available in accelerated memory.A negative return value indicates that the amount of accelerated memory on this GraphicsDevice is indeterminate.\n * @see java.awt.image.VolatileImage#flush\n * @see ImageCapabilities#isAccelerated\n * @since 1.4\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"memori":10,"particular":1,"whether":1,"situat":1,"amount":1,"given":1,"oper":2,"finit":2,"thread":1,"care":1,"report":1,"effici":1,"inquiri":1,"creat":2,"enabl":1,"avail":5,"number":3,"imag":10,"much":1,"size":1,"awt":1,"system":2,"configur":1,"acceler":7,"determin":1,"negat":1,"make":1,"alloc":1,"objectassoci":1,"creation":1,"call":1,"graphic":1,"link":1,"schedul":1,"use":2,"applic":1,"resourc":2,"indic":1,"full":1,"extent":1,"indetermin":1,"valu":1,"serv":1,"driver":1,"note":1,"may":3,"snapshot":1,"depend":1,"come":1,"still":1,"problem":1,"capabl":2,"cach":1,"flush":2,"exampl":1,"java":1,"method":3,"devic":2,"basi":1,"first":2},"maxFreq":10,"totalTerms":104},"loc":3}
