If the selection includes the rightmost (bottommost) position, the selection is extended to the right (bottom) of the bounds.  The height (width on vertical lines) of the selection is always extended to \u003ccode\u003ebounds\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e Although the selection is always contiguous, the logically selected text can be discontiguous on lines with mixed-direction text.  The logical ranges of text selected can be retrieved using \u003ccode\u003egetLogicalRangesForVisualSelection\u003c/code\u003e.  For example, consider the text \u0027ABCdef\u0027 where capital letters indicate right-to-left text, rendered on a right-to-left line, with a visual selection from 0L (the leading edge of \u0027A\u0027) to 3T (the trailing edge of \u0027d\u0027).  The text appears as follows, with bold underlined areas representing the selection: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cpre\u003e d\u003cu\u003e\u003cb\u003eefCBA  \u003c/b\u003e\u003c/u\u003e \u003c/pre\u003e The logical selection ranges are 0-3, 4-6 (ABC, ef) because the visually contiguous text is logically discontiguous.
