Systems which only support a single cursor size will return that size regardless of the desired sizes.

Since converting low-resolution images is difficult, no guarantees are made as to the quality of a cursor image which isn\u0027t a supported size.  It is therefore recommended that this method be called and an appropriate image used so no image conversion is made.\n * @param preferredWidth the preferred cursor width the component would liketo use.\n * @param preferredHeight the preferred cursor height the component would liketo use.\n * @return    the closest matching supported cursor size, or a dimension of 0,0 ifthe Toolkit implementation doesn\u0027t support custom cursors.\n * @exception HeadlessException if GraphicsEnvironment.isHeadless()returns true\n * @see java.awt.GraphicsEnvironment#isHeadless\n * @since     1.2\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"attempt":1,"call":1,"graphic":2,"cursor":9,"singl":1,"convers":1,"made":2,"use":4,"convert":1,"therefor":1,"difficult":1,"desir":2,"recommend":1,"resiz":1,"resolut":1,"height":2,"closest":2,"best":1,"toolkit":2,"note":1,"custom":2,"regardless":1,"except":2,"support":8,"ifth":1,"whose":1,"guarante":1,"width":2,"environ":2,"true":1,"qualiti":1,"liketo":2,"dimens":4,"imag":6,"headless":3,"size":9,"awt":1,"system":2,"compon":2,"appropri":1,"will":3,"java":1,"method":2,"match":2,"prefer":4,"low":1},"maxFreq":9,"totalTerms":102},"loc":11}
