The actual resolution will be determined by the limitations of the implementation and the target printer. Index 0 of the array specifies the cross feed direction resolution (typically the horizontal resolution). Index 1 of the array specifies the feed direction resolution (typically the vertical resolution). Index 2 of the array specifies whether the resolutions are in dots per inch or dots per centimeter. \u003ccode\u003e3\u003c/code\u003e denotes dots per inch. \u003ccode\u003e4\u003c/code\u003e denotes dots per centimeter. Note that the 1.1 printing implementation (Toolkit.getPrintJob) requires that the feed and cross feed resolutions be the same. Not specifying the property is equivalent to calling setPrinterResolution(72).\n * @param printerResolution an integer array of 3 elements. The firstelement must be greater than 0.
