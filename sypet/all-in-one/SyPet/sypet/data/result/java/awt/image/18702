When an \u003ccode\u003eImageConsumer\u003c/code\u003e being fed by an instance of this \u003ccode\u003eImageFilter\u003c/code\u003e requests a resend of the data in TDLR order, the \u003ccode\u003eFilteredImageSource\u003c/code\u003e invokes this method of the \u003ccode\u003eImageFilter\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e An \u003ccode\u003eImageFilter\u003c/code\u003e subclass might override this method or not, depending on if and how it can send data in TDLR order. Three possibilities exist: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003e Do not override this method. This makes the subclass use the default implementation, which is to forward the request to the indicated \u003ccode\u003eImageProducer\u003c/code\u003e using this filter as the requesting \u003ccode\u003eImageConsumer\u003c/code\u003e. This behavior is appropriate if the filter can determine that it will forward the pixels in TDLR order if its upstream producer object sends them in TDLR order. \u003cli\u003e Override the method to simply send the data. This is appropriate if the filter can handle the request itself \u0026#151; for example, if the generated pixels have been saved in some sort of buffer. \u003cli\u003e Override the method to do nothing. This is appropriate if the filter cannot produce filtered data in TDLR order. \u003c/ul\u003e\n * @see ImageProducer#requestTopDownLeftRightResend\n * @param ip the ImageProducer that is feeding this instance ofthe filter - also the ImageProducer that the request should be forwarded to if necessary\n * @exception NullPointerException if \u003ccode\u003eip\u003c/code\u003e is null\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"might":1,"simpli":1,"sort":1,"send":3,"save":1,"pixel":3,"behavior":1,"data":5,"use":2,"possibl":1,"object":1,"necessari":1,"buffer":1,"consum":3,"upstream":1,"indic":1,"order":6,"forward":3,"respond":1,"ofth":1,"request":7,"three":1,"noth":1,"feed":1,"left":3,"right":3,"exist":1,"top":3,"except":2,"invok":1,"depend":1,"resend":4,"produc":6,"imag":11,"handl":1,"instanc":2,"fed":1,"appropri":3,"generat":1,"determin":1,"exampl":1,"will":1,"subclass":2,"pointer":1,"sourc":1,"method":5,"also":1,"make":1,"filter":10},"maxFreq":11,"totalTerms":115},"loc":3}
