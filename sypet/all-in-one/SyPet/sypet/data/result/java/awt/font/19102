If the range includes the last logical character, the selection is extended to the portion of \u003ccode\u003ebounds\u003c/code\u003e after the end of this \u003ccode\u003eTextLayout\u003c/code\u003e. The height (width on vertical lines) of the selection is always extended to \u003ccode\u003ebounds\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003e The selection can be discontiguous on lines with mixed-direction text. Only those characters in the logical range between start and limit appear selected.  For example, consider the text \u0027ABCdef\u0027 where capital letters indicate right-to-left text, rendered on a right-to-left line, with a logical selection from 0 to 4 (\u0027ABCd\u0027).

Also note that since the range includes the first logical character (A), the selection is extended to the portion of the \u003ccode\u003ebounds\u003c/code\u003e before the start of the layout, which in this case (a right-to-left line) is the right portion of the \u003ccode\u003ebounds\u003c/code\u003e.\n * @param firstEndpoint an endpoint in the range of characters to select\n * @param secondEndpoint the other endpoint of the range of charactersto select.

The range includes the character at min(firstEndpoint, secondEndpoint), but excludes max(firstEndpoint, secondEndpoint).\n * @param bounds the bounding rectangle to which to extend the selection.This is in baseline-relative coordinates.\n * @return an area enclosing the selection.
