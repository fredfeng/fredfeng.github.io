Full layout is required for complex text, such as Arabic or Hindi.  Support for different scripts depends on the font and implementation. \u003cp\u003e Layout requires bidi analysis, as performed by \u003ccode\u003eBidi\u003c/code\u003e, and should only be performed on text that has a uniform direction.  The direction is indicated in the flags parameter,by using LAYOUT_RIGHT_TO_LEFT to indicate a right-to-left (Arabic and Hebrew) run direction, or LAYOUT_LEFT_TO_RIGHT to indicate a left-to-right (English) run direction. \u003cp\u003e In addition, some operations, such as Arabic shaping, require context, so that the characters at the start and limit can have the proper shapes.  Sometimes the data in the buffer outside the provided range does not have valid data.
