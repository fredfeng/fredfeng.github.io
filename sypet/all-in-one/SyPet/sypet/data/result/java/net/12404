The SO_SNDBUF option is used by the network implementation as a hint to size the underlying network I/O buffers. The SO_SNDBUF setting may also be used by the network implementation to determine the maximum size of the packet that can be sent on this socket. \u003cp\u003e As SO_SNDBUF is a hint, applications that want to verify what size the buffer is should call  {@link #getSendBufferSize()}. \u003cp\u003e Increasing the buffer size may allow multiple outgoing packets to be queued by the network implementation when the send rate is high. \u003cp\u003e Note: If  {@link #send(DatagramPacket)} is used to send a\u003ccode\u003eDatagramPacket\u003c/code\u003e that is larger than the setting of SO_SNDBUF then it is implementation specific if the packet is sent or discarded.\n * @param size the size to which to set the send buffersize.
