A port number of \u003ccode\u003e0\u003c/code\u003e means that the port number is automatically allocated, typically from an ephemeral port range. This port number can then be retrieved by calling  {@link #getLocalPort getLocalPort}. \u003cp\u003e The maximum queue length for incoming connection indications (a request to connect) is set to \u003ccode\u003e50\u003c/code\u003e.
