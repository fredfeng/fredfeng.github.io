This allows the parsing of URIs such as \u003ctt\u003e\"file:///foo/bar\"\u003c/tt\u003e, which seems to be the intent of RFC\u0026nbsp;2396 although the grammar does not permit it.

The primary consequence of this deviation is that a standalone fragment such as \u003ctt\u003e\"#foo\"\u003c/tt\u003e parses as a relative URI with an empty path and the given fragment, and can be usefully \u003ca href\u003d\"#resolve-frag\"\u003eresolved\u003c/a\u003e against a base URI. \u003cli\u003e\u003cp\u003e IPv4 addresses in host components are parsed rigorously, as specified by \u003ca href\u003d\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt\"\u003eRFC\u0026nbsp;2732\u003c/a\u003e: Each element of a dotted-quad address must contain no more than three decimal digits.
