Some implementations may offer alternative protocols which have different performance characteristics than TCP/IP.  This method allows the application to express its own preferences as to how these tradeoffs should be made when the implementation chooses from the available protocols. \u003cp\u003e Performance preferences are described by three integers whose values indicate the relative importance of short connection time, low latency, and high bandwidth.  The absolute values of the integers are irrelevant; in order to choose a protocol the values are simply compared, with larger values indicating stronger preferences. Negative values represent a lower priority than positive values. If the application prefers short connection time over both low latency and high bandwidth, for example, then it could invoke this method with the values \u003ctt\u003e(1, 0, 0)\u003c/tt\u003e.  If the application prefers high bandwidth above low latency, and low latency above short connection time, then it could invoke this method with the values \u003ctt\u003e(0, 1, 2)\u003c/tt\u003e. \u003cp\u003e Invoking this method after this socket has been connected will have no effect.\n * @param connectionTime An \u003ctt\u003eint\u003c/tt\u003e expressing the relative importance of a short connection time\n * @param latency An \u003ctt\u003eint\u003c/tt\u003e expressing the relative importance of low latency\n * @param bandwidth An \u003ctt\u003eint\u003c/tt\u003e expressing the relative importance of high bandwidth\n * @since 1.5\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"characterist":1,"simpli":1,"lower":1,"connect":6,"allow":1,"made":1,"use":1,"perform":4,"express":4,"applic":3,"bandwidth":5,"time":5,"order":1,"altern":1,"indic":2,"relat":4,"three":1,"socket":3,"choos":2,"valu":8,"may":1,"protocol":4,"prioriti":1,"repres":1,"whose":1,"invok":3,"stronger":1,"larger":1,"describ":1,"tradeoff":1,"avail":1,"absolut":1,"offer":1,"differ":1,"effect":1,"latenc":6,"will":1,"exampl":1,"irrelev":1,"negat":1,"method":4,"high":4,"low":5,"prefer":7,"posit":1,"compar":1,"integ":2},"maxFreq":8,"totalTerms":109},"loc":3}
