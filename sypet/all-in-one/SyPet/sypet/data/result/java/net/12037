The original ToASCII operation, as defined in RFC 3490, only operates on a single label. This method can handle both label and entire domain name, by assuming that labels in a domain name are always separated by dots. The following characters are recognized as dots: \u0026#0092;u002E (full stop), \u0026#0092;u3002 (ideographic full stop), \u0026#0092;uFF0E (fullwidth full stop), and \u0026#0092;uFF61 (halfwidth ideographic full stop). if dots are used as label separators, this method also changes all of them to \u0026#0092;u002E (full stop) in output translated string.\n * @param input     the string to be processed\n * @param flag      process flag; can be 0 or any logical OR of possible flags\n * @return          the translated \u003ctt\u003eString\u003c/tt\u003e\n * @throws IllegalArgumentException   if the input string doesn\u0027t conform to RFC 3490 specification\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"singl":1,"possibl":1,"dot":3,"fail":4,"oper":5,"internation":1,"href":1,"recogn":1,"follow":1,"argument":2,"thrown":1,"except":2,"charact":1,"alway":1,"label":5,"logic":1,"input":3,"encod":1,"flag":3,"http":1,"separ":2,"will":1,"output":1,"entir":1,"compat":1,"defin":2,"stop":5,"www":1,"use":2,"org":1,"txt":1,"rfc":2,"full":5,"name":4,"domain":4,"individu":1,"assum":1,"halfwidth":1,"origin":1,"fullwidth":1,"translat":3,"illeg":2,"ietf":1,"handl":1,"process":2,"specif":1,"ideograph":2,"conform":1,"string":6,"unicod":1,"method":2,"chang":1,"part":1,"also":1,"step":1},"maxFreq":6,"totalTerms":103},"loc":13}
