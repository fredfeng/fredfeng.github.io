The value actually set in the accepted socket must be determined by calling {@link Socket#getReceiveBufferSize()} after the socketis returned by  {@link #accept()}. \u003cp\u003e The value of SO_RCVBUF is used both to set the size of the internal socket receive buffer, and to set the size of the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer. \u003cp\u003e It is possible to change the value subsequently, by calling {@link Socket#setReceiveBufferSize(int)}. However, if the application wishes to allow a receive window larger than 64K bytes, as defined by RFC1323 then the proposed value must be set in the ServerSocket \u003cB\u003ebefore\u003c/B\u003e it is bound to a local address. This implies, that the ServerSocket must be created with the no-argument constructor, then setReceiveBufferSize() must be called and lastly the ServerSocket is bound to an address by calling bind(). \u003cp\u003e Failure to do this will not cause an error, and the buffer size may be set to the requested value but the TCP receive window in sockets accepted from this ServerSocket will be no larger than 64K bytes.\n * @exception SocketException if there is an errorin the underlying protocol, such as a TCP error.\n * @param size the size to which to set the receive buffersize.
