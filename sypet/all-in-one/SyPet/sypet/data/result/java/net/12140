The SO_RCVBUF option is used by the platform\u0027s networking code as a hint for the size to set the underlying network I/O buffers. \u003cp\u003eIncreasing the receive buffer size can increase the performance of network I/O for high-volume connection, while decreasing it can help reduce the backlog of incoming data. \u003cp\u003eBecause SO_RCVBUF is a hint, applications that want to verify what size the buffers were set to should call {@link #getReceiveBufferSize()}. \u003cp\u003eThe value of SO_RCVBUF is also used to set the TCP receive window that is advertized to the remote peer. Generally, the window size can be modified at any time when a socket is connected. However, if a receive window larger than 64K is required then this must be requested \u003cB\u003ebefore\u003c/B\u003e the socket is connected to the remote peer.
