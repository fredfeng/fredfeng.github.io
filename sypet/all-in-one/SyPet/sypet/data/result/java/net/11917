Best effort is made by the implementation to try to reach the host, but firewalls and server configuration may block requests resulting in a unreachable status while some specific ports may be accessible. A typical implementation will use ICMP ECHO REQUESTs if the privilege can be obtained, otherwise it will try to establish a TCP connection on port 7 (Echo) of the destination host. \u003cp\u003e The \u003ccode\u003enetwork interface\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ettl\u003c/code\u003e parameters let the caller specify which network interface the test will go through and the maximum number of hops the packets should go through. A negative value for the \u003ccode\u003ettl\u003c/code\u003e will result in an IllegalArgumentException being thrown. \u003cp\u003e The timeout value, in milliseconds, indicates the maximum amount of time the try should take.
