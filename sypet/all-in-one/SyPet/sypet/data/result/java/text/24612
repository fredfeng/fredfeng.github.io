This means that when you change direction while iterating (i.e., call next() and then call previous(), or call previous() and then call next()), you\u0027ll get back the same element twice.\u003c/p\u003e\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"call":4,"collat":5,"one":2,"next":6,"function":1,"twice":1,"order":1,"sequenc":1,"map":1,"current":1,"mean":2,"built":1,"direct":1,"element":8,"previous":3,"charact":2,"prioriti":1,"back":1,"point":2,"updat":2,"string":3,"intern":1,"pointer":2,"chang":1,"necessarili":1,"iter":4,"first":1,"thing":1},"maxFreq":8,"totalTerms":60},"loc":79}
