If parsing succeeds, then the index of \u003ccode\u003epos\u003c/code\u003e is updated to the index after the last character used (parsing does not necessarily use all characters up to the end of the string), and the parsed object is returned. The updated \u003ccode\u003epos\u003c/code\u003e can be used to indicate the starting point for the next call to this method.
