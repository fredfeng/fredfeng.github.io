{"id":11706,"className":"java.io.File","methodName":"createTempFile","signature":"\u003cjava.io.File: java.io.File createTempFile(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.io.File)\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * \u003cp\u003e Creates a new empty file in the specified directory, using the given prefix and suffix strings to generate its name.  If this method returns successfully then it is guaranteed that: \u003col\u003e \u003cli\u003e The file denoted by the returned abstract pathname did not exist before this method was invoked, and \u003cli\u003e Neither this method nor any of its variants will return the same abstract pathname again in the current invocation of the virtual machine. \u003c/ol\u003e This method provides only part of a temporary-file facility.  To arrange for a file created by this method to be deleted automatically, use the \u003ccode\u003e {@link #deleteOnExit}\u003c/code\u003e method. \u003cp\u003e The \u003ccode\u003eprefix\u003c/code\u003e argument must be at least three characters long.  It is recommended that the prefix be a short, meaningful string such as \u003ccode\u003e\"hjb\"\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003e\"mail\"\u003c/code\u003e.  The \u003ccode\u003esuffix\u003c/code\u003e argument may be \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e, in which case the suffix \u003ccode\u003e\".tmp\"\u003c/code\u003e will be used. \u003cp\u003e To create the new file, the prefix and the suffix may first be adjusted to fit the limitations of the underlying platform.  If the prefix is too long then it will be truncated, but its first three characters will always be preserved.  If the suffix is too long then it too will be truncated, but if it begins with a period character (\u003ccode\u003e\u0027.\u0027\u003c/code\u003e) then the period and the first three characters following it will always be preserved.  Once these adjustments have been made the name of the new file will be generated by concatenating the prefix, five or more internally-generated characters, and the suffix. \u003cp\u003e If the \u003ccode\u003edirectory\u003c/code\u003e argument is \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e then the system-dependent default temporary-file directory will be used.  The default temporary-file directory is specified by the system property \u003ccode\u003ejava.io.tmpdir\u003c/code\u003e.  On UNIX systems the default value of this property is typically \u003ccode\u003e\"/tmp\"\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003e\"/var/tmp\"\u003c/code\u003e; on Microsoft Windows systems it is typically \u003ccode\u003e\"C:\\\\WINNT\\\\TEMP\"\u003c/code\u003e.  A different value may be given to this system property when the Java virtual machine is invoked, but programmatic changes to this property are not guaranteed to have any effect upon the temporary directory used by this method.\n * @param prefix     The prefix string to be used in generating the file\u0027sname; must be at least three characters long\n * @param suffix     The suffix string to be used in generating the file\u0027sname; may be \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e, in which case the suffix \u003ccode\u003e\".tmp\"\u003c/code\u003e will be used\n * @param directory  The directory in which the file is to be created, or\u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e if the default temporary-file directory is to be used\n * @return  An abstract pathname denoting a newly-created empty file\n * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the \u003ccode\u003eprefix\u003c/code\u003e argument contains fewer than three characters\n * @throws IOException  If a file could not be created\n * @throws SecurityException If a security manager exists and its \u003ccode\u003e {@link java.lang.SecurityManager#checkWrite(java.lang.String)}\u003c/code\u003e method does not allow a file to be created\n * @since 1.2\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"programmat":1,"least":2,"must":2,"specifi":2,"given":2,"file":16,"three":5,"tmp":4,"follow":1,"limit":1,"facil":1,"argument":5,"platform":1,"except":3,"pathnam":3,"creat":8,"charact":7,"hjb":1,"alway":2,"invok":2,"concaten":1,"preserv":2,"period":2,"provid":1,"invoc":1,"exit":1,"newli":1,"system":5,"machin":2,"window":1,"contain":1,"prefix":9,"will":9,"fewer":1,"temp":1,"properti":4,"upon":1,"virtual":2,"allow":1,"directori":8,"delet":2,"var":1,"link":2,"typic":2,"made":1,"denot":2,"truncat":2,"use":9,"sname":2,"lang":2,"variant":1,"automat":1,"recommend":1,"microsoft":1,"fit":1,"name":2,"write":1,"adjust":2,"current":1,"temporari":5,"valu":2,"exist":2,"mail":1,"may":4,"five":1,"check":1,"manag":2,"depend":1,"guarante":2,"meaning":1,"illeg":1,"suffix":9,"arrang":1,"begin":1,"empti":2,"neither":1,"differ":1,"secur":3,"effect":1,"string":5,"generat":5,"intern":1,"java":4,"method":8,"chang":1,"tmpdir":1,"part":1,"success":1,"first":3},"maxFreq":16,"totalTerms":231},"loc":24}
