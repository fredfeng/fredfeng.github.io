While similar to resolveObject these validations are called after the entire graph has been reconstituted.  Typically, a readObject method will register the object with the stream so that when all of the objects are restored a final set of validations can be performed.\n * @param obj the object to receive the validation callback.\n * @param prio controls the order of callbacks;zero is a good default.Use higher numbers to be called back earlier, lower numbers for later callbacks. Within a priority, callbacks are processed in no particular order.\n * @throws NotActiveException The stream is not currently reading objectsso it is invalid to register a callback.\n * @throws InvalidObjectException The validation object is null.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"call":2,"valid":6,"stream":2,"lower":1,"higher":1,"typic":1,"particular":1,"use":1,"perform":1,"good":1,"object":8,"activ":1,"zero":1,"graph":2,"invalid":2,"order":2,"objectsso":1,"current":1,"read":2,"regist":4,"similar":1,"control":1,"except":2,"prioriti":1,"later":1,"back":1,"resolv":1,"number":2,"receiv":1,"reconstitut":1,"process":1,"earlier":1,"will":1,"restor":1,"callback":5,"method":1,"obj":1,"within":1,"prio":1,"entir":1},"maxFreq":8,"totalTerms":67},"loc":6}
