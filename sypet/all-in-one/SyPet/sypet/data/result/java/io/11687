Otherwise an array of  {@code File} objectsis returned, one for each file or directory in the directory.  Pathnames denoting the directory itself and the directory\u0027s parent directory are not included in the result.  Each resulting abstract pathname is constructed from this abstract pathname using the  {@link #File(File,String) File(File,\u0026nbsp;String)} constructor.  Therefore if thispathname is absolute then each resulting pathname is absolute; if this pathname is relative then each resulting pathname will be relative to the same directory. \u003cp\u003e There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular, guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order. \u003cp\u003e Note that the  {@link java.nio.file.Files} class defines the {@link java.nio.file.Files#newDirectoryStream(Path) newDirectoryStream} methodto open a directory and iterate over the names of the files in the directory.
