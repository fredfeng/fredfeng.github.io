It reads successive bytes, converting each byte separately into a character, until it encounters a line terminator or end of file; the characters read are then returned as a \u003ccode\u003eString\u003c/code\u003e. Note that because this method processes bytes, it does not support input of the full Unicode character set. \u003cp\u003e If end of file is encountered before even one byte can be read, then \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e is returned. Otherwise, each byte that is read is converted to type \u003ccode\u003echar\u003c/code\u003e by zero-extension. If the character \u003ccode\u003e\u0027\\n\u0027\u003c/code\u003e is encountered, it is discarded and reading ceases. If the character \u003ccode\u003e\u0027\\r\u0027\u003c/code\u003e is encountered, it is discarded and, if the following byte converts \u0026#32;to the character \u003ccode\u003e\u0027\\n\u0027\u003c/code\u003e, then that is discarded also; reading then ceases.

Once reading has ceased, a \u003ccode\u003eString\u003c/code\u003e is returned that contains all the characters read and not discarded, taken in order.
