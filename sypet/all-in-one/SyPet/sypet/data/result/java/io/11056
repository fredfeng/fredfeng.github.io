The class of the object, the signature of the class, and the values of the non-transient and non-static fields of the class and all of its supertypes are read. Default deserializing for a class can be overriden using the writeObject and readObject methods.  Objects referenced by this object are read transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of objects is reconstructed by readObject. \u003cp\u003eThe root object is completely restored when all of its fields and the objects it references are completely restored.  At this point the object validation callbacks are executed in order based on their registered priorities. The callbacks are registered by objects (in the readObject special methods) as they are individually restored. \u003cp\u003eExceptions are thrown for problems with the InputStream and for classes that should not be deserialized.  All exceptions are fatal to the InputStream and leave it in an indeterminate state; it is up to the caller to ignore or recover the stream state.\n * @throws ClassNotFoundException Class of a serialized object cannot befound.\n * @throws InvalidClassException Something is wrong with a class used byserialization.\n * @throws StreamCorruptedException Control information in thestream is inconsistent.\n * @throws OptionalDataException Primitive data was found in thestream instead of objects.\n * @throws IOException Any of the usual Input/Output related exceptions.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"root":1,"corrupt":1,"transit":1,"referenc":1,"recov":1,"invalid":1,"refer":1,"equival":1,"relat":1,"option":1,"control":1,"except":8,"thrown":1,"ignor":1,"befound":1,"prioriti":1,"fatal":1,"non":2,"inform":1,"input":4,"thestream":2,"restor":3,"leav":1,"output":1,"execut":1,"caller":1,"primit":1,"inconsist":1,"valid":1,"byseri":1,"stream":5,"data":2,"state":2,"use":2,"object":17,"signatur":1,"someth":1,"graph":1,"order":1,"reconstruct":1,"write":1,"read":7,"regist":2,"indetermin":1,"valu":1,"complet":3,"individu":1,"usual":1,"overriden":1,"supertyp":1,"problem":1,"field":2,"point":1,"instead":1,"callback":2,"base":1,"wrong":1,"method":2,"special":1,"deseri":2,"serial":1,"found":2},"maxFreq":17,"totalTerms":113},"loc":25}
