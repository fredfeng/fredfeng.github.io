Names denoting the directory itself and the directory\u0027s parent directory are not included in the result.  Each string is a file name rather than a complete path. \u003cp\u003e There is no guarantee that the name strings in the resulting array will appear in any specific order; they are not, in particular, guaranteed to appear in alphabetical order. \u003cp\u003e Note that the  {@link java.nio.file.Files} class defines the {@link java.nio.file.Files#newDirectoryStream(Path) newDirectoryStream} method toopen a directory and iterate over the names of the files in the directory.
