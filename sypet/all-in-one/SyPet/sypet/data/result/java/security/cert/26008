The \u003ccode\u003epathLenConstraint\u003c/code\u003e field (see below) is meaningful only if \u003ccode\u003ecA\u003c/code\u003e is set to TRUE. In this case, it gives the maximum number of CA certificates that may follow this certificate in a certification path. A value of zero indicates that only an end-entity certificate may follow in the path. \u003cp\u003e The ASN.1 definition for this is: \u003cpre\u003e BasicConstraints ::\u003d SEQUENCE { cA                  BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE, pathLenConstraint   INTEGER (0..MAX) OPTIONAL } \u003c/pre\u003e\n * @return the value of \u003ccode\u003epathLenConstraint\u003c/code\u003e if theBasicConstraints extension is present in the certificate and the subject of the certificate is a CA, otherwise -1.
