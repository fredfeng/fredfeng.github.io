A certificate is self-issued if the DNs that appear in the subject and issuer fields are identical and are not empty. Note that the last certificate in a certification path is not an intermediate certificate, and is not included in this limit. Usually the last certificate is an end entity certificate, but it can be a CA certificate. A PKIX \u003ccode\u003eCertPathBuilder\u003c/code\u003e instance must not build paths longer than the length specified. \u003cp\u003e A value of 0 implies that the path can only contain a single certificate. A value of -1 implies that the path length is unconstrained (i.e. there is no maximum). The default maximum path length, if not specified, is 5. Setting a value less than -1 will cause an exception to be thrown. \u003cp\u003e If any of the CA certificates contain the \u003ccode\u003eBasicConstraintsExtension\u003c/code\u003e, the value of the \u003ccode\u003epathLenConstraint\u003c/code\u003e field of the extension overrides the maximum path length parameter whenever the result is a certification path of smaller length.\n * @param maxPathLength the maximum number of non-self-issued intermediatecertificates that may exist in a certification path\n * @throws InvalidParameterException if \u003ccode\u003emaxPathLength\u003c/code\u003e is setto a value less than -1\n * @see #getMaxPathLength\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"appear":1,"last":2,"singl":1,"must":1,"intermedi":2,"specifi":2,"invalid":1,"basic":1,"impli":2,"longer":1,"limit":1,"except":2,"thrown":1,"builder":1,"number":2,"unconstrain":1,"non":2,"instanc":1,"issuer":1,"entiti":1,"maximum":5,"contain":2,"will":1,"result":1,"subject":1,"constraint":2,"self":3,"build":1,"issu":3,"smaller":1,"cert":1,"ident":1,"extens":2,"intermediatecertif":1,"path":15,"length":9,"valu":6,"exist":2,"note":1,"end":1,"less":2,"usual":1,"whenev":1,"certif":13,"may":2,"includ":1,"max":4,"dns":1,"paramet":2,"len":1,"empti":1,"field":2,"caus":1,"setto":1},"maxFreq":15,"totalTerms":119},"loc":7}
