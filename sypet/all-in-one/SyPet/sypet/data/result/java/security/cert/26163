A typical implementation performs a \"deep copy\" of this object, but this is not an absolute requirement. Some implementations may perform a \"shallow copy\" of some or all of the fields of this object. \u003cp\u003e Note that the \u003ccode\u003eCertStore.getInstance\u003c/code\u003e methods make a copy of the specified \u003ccode\u003eCertStoreParameters\u003c/code\u003e. A deep copy implementation of \u003ccode\u003eclone\u003c/code\u003e is safer and more robust, as it prevents the caller from corrupting a shared \u003ccode\u003eCertStore\u003c/code\u003e by subsequently modifying the contents of its initialization parameters. However, a shallow copy implementation of \u003ccode\u003eclone\u003c/code\u003e is more appropriate for applications that need to hold a reference to a parameter contained in the \u003ccode\u003eCertStoreParameters\u003c/code\u003e. For example, a shallow copy clone allows an application to release the resources of a particular \u003ccode\u003eCertStore\u003c/code\u003e initialization parameter immediately, rather than waiting for the garbage collection mechanism. This should be done with the utmost care, since the \u003ccode\u003eCertStore\u003c/code\u003e may still be in use by other threads. \u003cp\u003e Each subclass should state the precise behavior of this method so that users and developers know what to expect.\n * @return a copy of this \u003ccode\u003eCertStoreParameters\u003c/code\u003e\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"store":9,"particular":1,"perform":2,"wait":1,"garbag":1,"corrupt":1,"copi":9,"specifi":1,"expect":1,"requir":1,"refer":1,"thread":1,"care":1,"precis":2,"howev":1,"deep":2,"clone":4,"shallow":3,"done":1,"hold":1,"prevent":1,"absolut":1,"instanc":1,"content":1,"contain":1,"subclass":1,"make":2,"collect":1,"caller":1,"allow":1,"behavior":1,"state":1,"typic":1,"use":1,"object":3,"utmost":1,"applic":2,"share":1,"resourc":1,"cert":9,"releas":1,"safer":1,"mean":1,"rather":1,"immedi":1,"develop":1,"initi":2,"subsequ":1,"note":1,"robust":1,"may":3,"depend":1,"paramet":8,"still":1,"know":1,"field":1,"mechan":1,"appropri":1,"modifi":1,"exampl":1,"method":2,"user":1},"maxFreq":9,"totalTerms":110},"loc":0}
