The specified name is added to any previous value for the pathToNames criterion.  If the name is a duplicate, it may be ignored. \u003cp\u003e The name is provided in string format. RFC 822, DNS, and URI names use the well-established string formats for those types (subject to the restrictions included in RFC 3280). IPv4 address names are supplied using dotted quad notation. OID address names are represented as a series of nonnegative integers separated by periods. And directory names (distinguished names) are supplied in RFC 2253 format. No standard string format is defined for otherNames, X.400 names, EDI party names, IPv6 address names, or any other type of names.
