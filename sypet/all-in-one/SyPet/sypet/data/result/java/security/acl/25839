This set of allowed permissions is calculated as follows:\u003cp\u003e \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003eIf there is no entry in this Access Control List for the specified principal, an empty permission set is returned.\u003cp\u003e \u003cli\u003eOtherwise, the principal\u0027s group permission sets are determined. (A principal can belong to one or more groups, where a group is a group of principals, represented by the Group interface.) The group positive permission set is the union of all the positive permissions of each group that the principal belongs to. The group negative permission set is the union of all the negative permissions of each group that the principal belongs to. If there is a specific permission that occurs in both the positive permission set and the negative permission set, it is removed from both.\u003cp\u003e The individual positive and negative permission sets are also determined. The positive permission set contains the permissions specified in the positive ACL entry (if any) for the principal. Similarly, the negative permission set contains the permissions specified in the negative ACL entry (if any) for the principal. The individual positive (or negative) permission set is considered to be null if there is not a positive (negative) ACL entry for the principal in this ACL.\u003cp\u003e The set of permissions granted to the principal is then calculated using the simple rule that individual permissions always override the group permissions. That is, the principal\u0027s individual negative permission set (specific denial of permissions) overrides the group positive permission set, and the principal\u0027s individual positive permission set overrides the group negative permission set. \u003c/ul\u003e\n * @param user the principal whose permission set is to be returned.\n * @return the permission set specifying the permissions the principalis allowed.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"otherwis":1,"simpl":1,"grant":1,"allow":3,"belong":3,"one":1,"use":1,"principali":1,"consid":1,"specifi":5,"rule":1,"union":2,"permiss":29,"denial":1,"similar":1,"follow":1,"individu":6,"control":1,"whose":1,"repres":2,"alway":1,"entri":4,"calcul":2,"remov":1,"list":1,"access":1,"empti":1,"specif":2,"entiti":1,"contain":2,"determin":2,"negat":10,"group":13,"user":1,"also":1,"posit":10,"princip":14,"occur":1},"maxFreq":29,"totalTerms":131},"loc":0}
