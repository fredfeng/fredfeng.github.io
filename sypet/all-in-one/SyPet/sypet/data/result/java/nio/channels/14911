{"id":14911,"className":"java.nio.channels.FileChannel","methodName":"force","signature":"\u003cjava.nio.channels.FileChannel: void force(boolean)\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Forces any updates to this channel\u0027s file to be written to the storage device that contains it. \u003cp\u003e If this channel\u0027s file resides on a local storage device then when this method returns it is guaranteed that all changes made to the file since this channel was created, or since this method was last invoked, will have been written to that device.  This is useful for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash. \u003cp\u003e If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee is made. \u003cp\u003e The \u003ctt\u003emetaData\u003c/tt\u003e parameter can be used to limit the number of I/O operations that this method is required to perform.  Passing \u003ctt\u003efalse\u003c/tt\u003e for this parameter indicates that only updates to the file\u0027s content need be written to storage; passing \u003ctt\u003etrue\u003c/tt\u003e indicates that updates to both the file\u0027s content and metadata must be written, which generally requires at least one more I/O operation. Whether this parameter actually has any effect is dependent upon the underlying operating system and is therefore unspecified. \u003cp\u003e Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the channel was only opened for reading.  Some operating systems, for example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file\u0027s metadata, and this time is updated whenever the file is read.  Whether or not this is actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified. \u003cp\u003e This method is only guaranteed to force changes that were made to this channel\u0027s file via the methods defined in this class.  It may or may not force changes that were made by modifying the content of a {@link MappedByteBuffer \u003ci\u003emapped byte buffer\u003c/i\u003e} obtained byinvoking the  {@link #map map} method.  Invoking the {@link MappedByteBuffer#force force} method of the mapped byte buffer willforce changes made to the buffer\u0027s content to be written.  \u003c/p\u003e\n * @param metaData If \u003ctt\u003etrue\u003c/tt\u003e then this method is required to force changes to both the file\u0027s content and metadata to be written to storage; otherwise, it need only force content changes to be written\n * @throws ClosedChannelException If this channel is closed\n * @throws IOException If some other I/O error occurs\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":1,"need":2,"via":1,"last":2,"least":1,"maintain":1,"perform":1,"must":1,"whether":2,"close":2,"buffer":5,"open":1,"time":2,"requir":3,"oper":5,"event":1,"file":10,"willforc":1,"crash":1,"metadata":3,"limit":1,"except":2,"creat":1,"invok":3,"done":1,"number":1,"content":6,"inform":1,"obtain":1,"system":4,"updat":4,"contain":1,"will":1,"even":1,"upon":1,"critic":1,"otherwis":1,"defin":1,"unspecifi":2,"byinvok":1,"lost":1,"link":3,"one":1,"made":5,"data":2,"use":2,"therefor":2,"meta":2,"ensur":1,"indic":2,"written":7,"map":6,"read":2,"forc":8,"whenev":1,"may":3,"resid":2,"error":1,"depend":2,"guarante":3,"paramet":3,"true":2,"access":1,"storag":4,"general":1,"pass":2,"caus":1,"effect":1,"modifi":1,"exampl":1,"actual":2,"method":9,"chang":6,"devic":4,"local":2,"part":1,"channel":7,"occur":2},"maxFreq":10,"totalTerms":187},"loc":0}
