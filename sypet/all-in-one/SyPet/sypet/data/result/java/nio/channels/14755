This byte sequence will be transferred into the buffer so that the first byte in the sequence is at index \u003ci\u003ep\u003c/i\u003e and the last byte is at index \u003ci\u003ep\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003ctt\u003e+\u003c/tt\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003ci\u003en\u003c/i\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003ctt\u003e-\u003c/tt\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003ctt\u003e1\u003c/tt\u003e, where \u003ci\u003ep\u003c/i\u003e is the buffer\u0027s position at the moment this method is invoked.

Whether or not it does so depends upon the nature and state of the channel.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode, for example, cannot read any more bytes than are immediately available from the socket\u0027s input buffer; similarly, a file channel cannot read any more bytes than remain in the file.  It is guaranteed, however, that if a channel is in blocking mode and there is at least one byte remaining in the buffer then this method will block until at least one byte is read. \u003cp\u003e This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has already initiated a read operation upon this channel, however, then an invocation of this method will block until the first operation is complete. \u003c/p\u003e\n * @param dst The buffer into which bytes are to be transferred\n * @return  The number of bytes read, possibly zero, or \u003ctt\u003e-1\u003c/tt\u003e if thechannel has reached end-of-stream\n * @throws NonReadableChannelException If this channel was not opened for reading\n * @throws ClosedChannelException If this channel is closed\n * @throws AsynchronousCloseException If another thread closes this channel while the read operation is in progress\n * @throws ClosedByInterruptException If another thread interrupts the current thread while the read operation is in progress, thereby closing the channel and setting the current thread\u0027s interrupt status\n * @throws IOException If some other I/O error occurs\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"progress":2,"last":1,"least":2,"therebi":1,"possibl":1,"natur":1,"thechannel":1,"dst":2,"zero":1,"whether":1,"close":6,"buffer":9,"open":1,"time":1,"given":1,"oper":5,"sequenc":4,"file":2,"thread":5,"socket":2,"howev":2,"nbsp":10,"limit":1,"except":5,"index":2,"transfer":2,"status":1,"invok":3,"number":2,"avail":1,"invoc":1,"non":2,"input":1,"will":5,"posit":2,"upon":3,"attempt":1,"asynchron":1,"might":2,"stream":1,"moment":2,"readabl":1,"one":2,"made":1,"state":1,"block":4,"anoth":3,"mode":2,"reach":1,"current":2,"length":1,"read":14,"immedi":1,"initi":1,"end":1,"complet":1,"similar":1,"may":1,"error":1,"depend":1,"guarante":1,"fill":1,"suppos":1,"equal":1,"interrupt":3,"fact":1,"remain":4,"exampl":1,"alreadi":1,"method":5,"chang":1,"first":2,"channel":13,"occur":1},"maxFreq":14,"totalTerms":175},"loc":0}
