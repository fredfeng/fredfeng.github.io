This method checks that a file exists and that this Java virtual machine has appropriate privileges to  {@link Runtime#exec execute} the file. The semantics may differ when checkingaccess to a directory. For example, on UNIX systems, checking for execute access checks that the Java virtual machine has permission to search the directory in order to access file or subdirectories. \u003cp\u003e Depending on the implementation, this method may require to read file permissions, access control lists, or other file attributes in order to check the effective access to the file. Consequently, this method may not be atomic with respect to other file system operations. \u003cp\u003e Note that the result of this method is immediately outdated, there is no guarantee that a subsequent attempt to execute the file will succeed (or even that it will access the same file). Care should be taken when using this method in security sensitive applications.\n * @param path the path to the file to check\n * @return  {@code true} if the file exists and is executable; {@code false}if the file does not exist, execute access would be denied because the Java virtual machine has insufficient privileges, or access cannot be determined\n * @throws SecurityException In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is installed, the  {@link SecurityManager#checkExec(String) checkExec} is invoked to check execute access to the file.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":1,"atom":1,"test":1,"consequ":1,"whether":1,"requir":1,"search":1,"oper":1,"file":14,"care":1,"permiss":2,"taken":1,"deni":1,"control":1,"except":1,"sensit":1,"succeed":1,"invok":1,"runtim":1,"provid":1,"insuffici":1,"system":2,"machin":3,"determin":1,"will":2,"exec":3,"even":1,"execut":8,"virtual":3,"attempt":1,"result":1,"outdat":1,"directori":2,"link":2,"use":1,"subdirectori":1,"applic":1,"attribut":1,"order":2,"semant":1,"path":2,"read":1,"immedi":1,"subsequ":1,"exist":3,"privileg":2,"note":1,"may":3,"check":8,"manag":2,"depend":1,"guarante":1,"instal":1,"true":1,"list":1,"access":8,"differ":1,"secur":4,"effect":1,"checkingaccess":1,"appropri":1,"string":1,"exampl":1,"method":5,"java":3,"respect":1},"maxFreq":14,"totalTerms":128},"loc":3}
