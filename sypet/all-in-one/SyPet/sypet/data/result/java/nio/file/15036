The order of the elements isnot defined and the file stores may change during the lifetime of the Java virtual machine. When an I/O error occurs, perhaps because a file store is not accessible, then it is not returned by the iterator. \u003cp\u003e In the case of the default provider, and a security manager is installed, the security manager is invoked to check  {@link RuntimePermission}\u003ctt\u003e(\"getFileStoreAttributes\")\u003c/tt\u003e. If denied, then no file stores are returned by the iterator. In addition, the security manager\u0027s  {@link SecurityManager#checkRead(String)} method is invoked tocheck read access to the file store\u0027s \u003cem\u003etop-most\u003c/em\u003e directory.
