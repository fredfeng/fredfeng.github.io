Once connected, datagrams may not be received from or sent to any other address.  A datagram socket remains connected until it is explicitly disconnected or until it is closed. \u003cp\u003e This method performs exactly the same security checks as the  {@link java.net.DatagramSocket#connect connect} method of the {@link java.net.DatagramSocket} class.  That is, if a security manager has beeninstalled then this method verifies that its  {@link java.lang.SecurityManager#checkAccept checkAccept} and {@link java.lang.SecurityManager#checkConnect checkConnect} methods permitdatagrams to be received from and sent to, respectively, the given remote address. \u003cp\u003e This method may be invoked at any time.  It will not have any effect on read or write operations that are already in progress at the moment that it is invoked. If this channel\u0027s socket is not bound then this method will first cause the socket to be bound to an address that is assigned automatically, as if invoking the  {@link #bind bind} method with aparameter of  {@code null}. \u003c/p\u003e\n * @param remote The remote address to which this channel is to be connected\n * @return  This datagram channel\n * @throws ClosedChannelException If this channel is closed\n * @throws AsynchronousCloseException If another thread closes this channel while the connect operation is in progress\n * @throws ClosedByInterruptException If another thread interrupts the current thread while the connect operation is in progress, thereby closing the channel and setting the current thread\u0027s interrupt status\n * @throws SecurityException If a security manager has been installed and it does not permit access to the given remote address\n * @throws IOException If some other I/O error occurs\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"progress":3,"assign":1,"send":1,"accept":2,"permit":1,"therebi":1,"perform":1,"close":7,"sent":2,"time":1,"given":3,"oper":3,"thread":4,"exact":1,"verifi":1,"socket":7,"except":5,"status":1,"invok":3,"configur":1,"explicit":1,"remot":5,"will":2,"asynchron":1,"connect":11,"moment":1,"link":5,"anoth":2,"net":2,"aparamet":1,"lang":2,"automat":1,"current":2,"write":1,"read":1,"peer":1,"may":2,"error":1,"check":5,"manag":4,"instal":1,"permitdatagram":1,"receiv":3,"access":1,"interrupt":3,"datagram":7,"secur":6,"caus":1,"remain":1,"effect":1,"address":6,"beeninstal":1,"java":4,"method":7,"disconnect":1,"alreadi":1,"channel":9,"first":1,"bind":2,"respect":1,"bound":2,"occur":1},"maxFreq":11,"totalTerms":161},"loc":0}
