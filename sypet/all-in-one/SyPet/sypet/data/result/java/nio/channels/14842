This is useful for ensuring that critical information is not lost in the event of a system crash. \u003cp\u003e If the file does not reside on a local device then no such guarantee is made. \u003cp\u003e The  {@code metaData} parameter can be used to limit the number ofI/O operations that this method is required to perform.  Passing {@code false} for this parameter indicates that only updates to thefile\u0027s content need be written to storage; passing  {@code true}indicates that updates to both the file\u0027s content and metadata must be written, which generally requires at least one more I/O operation. Whether this parameter actually has any effect is dependent upon the underlying operating system and is therefore unspecified. \u003cp\u003e Invoking this method may cause an I/O operation to occur even if the channel was only opened for reading.  Some operating systems, for example, maintain a last-access time as part of a file\u0027s metadata, and this time is updated whenever the file is read.  Whether or not this is actually done is system-dependent and is therefore unspecified. \u003cp\u003e This method is only guaranteed to force changes that were made to this channel\u0027s file via the methods defined in this class.\n * @param metaData If  {@code true} then this method is required to force changesto both the file\u0027s content and metadata to be written to storage; otherwise, it need only force content changes to be written\n * @throws ClosedChannelException If this channel is closed\n * @throws IOException If some other I/O error occurs\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"fals":1,"need":2,"via":1,"last":2,"least":1,"maintain":1,"perform":1,"must":1,"whether":2,"close":2,"open":1,"time":2,"requir":3,"oper":5,"event":1,"file":9,"crash":1,"metadata":3,"changesto":1,"limit":1,"except":2,"creat":1,"invok":2,"done":1,"number":1,"content":4,"inform":1,"system":4,"updat":4,"contain":1,"will":1,"even":1,"upon":1,"critic":1,"otherwis":1,"defin":1,"unspecifi":2,"lost":1,"one":1,"made":3,"data":2,"use":2,"thefil":1,"therefor":2,"meta":2,"ensur":1,"indic":2,"written":6,"read":2,"forc":5,"whenev":1,"may":1,"resid":2,"error":1,"depend":2,"guarante":3,"paramet":3,"true":2,"access":1,"storag":4,"general":1,"pass":2,"caus":1,"effect":1,"exampl":1,"actual":2,"method":7,"chang":3,"devic":4,"local":2,"part":1,"channel":7,"occur":2},"maxFreq":9,"totalTerms":154},"loc":0}
