The driver will ignore this signal if the SQL statement is not an \u003ccode\u003eINSERT\u003c/code\u003e statement, or an SQL statement able to return auto-generated keys (the list of such statements is vendor-specific). \u003cP\u003e In some (uncommon) situations, a single SQL statement may return multiple result sets and/or update counts.  Normally you can ignore this unless you are (1) executing a stored procedure that you know may return multiple results or (2) you are dynamically executing an unknown SQL string. \u003cP\u003e The \u003ccode\u003eexecute\u003c/code\u003e method executes an SQL statement and indicates the form of the first result.
