For example in a special register, session parameter, or system table column.  For efficiency the driver may defer setting the value in the database until the next time a statement is executed or prepared.  Other than storing the client information in the appropriate place in the database, these methods shall not alter the behavior of the connection in anyway.  The values supplied to these methods are used for accounting, diagnostics and debugging purposes only. \u003cp\u003e The driver shall generate a warning if the client info name specified is not recognized by the driver. \u003cp\u003e If the value specified to this method is greater than the maximum length for the property the driver may either truncate the value and generate a warning or generate a \u003ccode\u003eSQLClientInfoException\u003c/code\u003e.
