The method \u003ccode\u003esetLogWriter\u003c/code\u003e cannot create a \u003ccode\u003ePrintStream\u003c/code\u003e object that will be returned by \u003ccode\u003egetLogStream\u003c/code\u003e---the Java platform does not provide a backward conversion.  As a result, a new application that uses \u003ccode\u003esetLogWriter\u003c/code\u003e and also uses a JDBC 1.0 driver that uses \u003ccode\u003egetLogStream\u003c/code\u003e will likely not see debugging information written by that driver. \u003cP\u003e Starting with the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.3 release, this method checks to see that there is an \u003ccode\u003eSQLPermission\u003c/code\u003e object before setting the logging stream.  If a \u003ccode\u003eSecurityManager\u003c/code\u003e exists and its \u003ccode\u003echeckPermission\u003c/code\u003e method denies setting the log writer, this method throws a \u003ccode\u003ejava.lang.SecurityException\u003c/code\u003e.\n * @param out the new logging/tracing \u003ccode\u003ePrintStream\u003c/code\u003e object;\u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e to disable logging and tracing\n * @throws SecurityException if a security manager exists and its \u003ccode\u003echeckPermission\u003c/code\u003e method denies setting the log writer\n * @see SecurityManager#checkPermission\n * @see #getLogWriter\n * @since 1.2\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"result":1,"stream":5,"minor":1,"backward":1,"convers":1,"use":4,"debug":1,"object":4,"lang":1,"applic":1,"version":2,"releas":1,"written":1,"permiss":3,"driver":4,"writer":8,"exist":2,"deni":2,"lpermiss":1,"platform":1,"except":2,"check":4,"standard":1,"creat":2,"manag":4,"trace":3,"edit":1,"problem":1,"like":1,"log":13,"provid":1,"print":3,"inform":1,"secur":5,"disabl":1,"start":1,"will":2,"introduct":1,"method":6,"java":3,"also":1},"maxFreq":13,"totalTerms":102},"loc":9}
