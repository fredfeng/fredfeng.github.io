This object can then be used to efficiently execute this statement multiple times. \u003cP\u003e\u003cB\u003eNote:\u003c/B\u003e This method is optimized for handling parametric SQL statements that benefit from precompilation. If the driver supports precompilation, the method \u003ccode\u003eprepareStatement\u003c/code\u003e will send the statement to the database for precompilation. Some drivers may not support precompilation. In this case, the statement may not be sent to the database until the \u003ccode\u003ePreparedStatement\u003c/code\u003e object is executed.  This has no direct effect on users; however, it does affect which methods throw certain \u003ccode\u003eSQLException\u003c/code\u003e objects. \u003cP\u003e Result sets created using the returned \u003ccode\u003ePreparedStatement\u003c/code\u003e object will by default be type \u003ccode\u003eTYPE_FORWARD_ONLY\u003c/code\u003e and have a concurrency level of \u003ccode\u003eCONCUR_READ_ONLY\u003c/code\u003e.
