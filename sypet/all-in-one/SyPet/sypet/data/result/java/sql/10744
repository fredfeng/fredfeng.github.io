The \u003ccode\u003eProperties\u003c/code\u003e object contains the names and values of the client info properties to be set.  The set of client info properties contained in the properties list replaces the current set of client info properties on the connection.  If a property that is currently set on the connection is not present in the properties list, that property is cleared.  Specifying an empty properties list will clear all of the properties on the connection.  See \u003ccode\u003esetClientInfo (String, String)\u003c/code\u003e for more information. \u003cp\u003e If an error occurs in setting any of the client info properties, a \u003ccode\u003eSQLClientInfoException\u003c/code\u003e is thrown. The \u003ccode\u003eSQLClientInfoException\u003c/code\u003e contains information indicating which client info properties were not set. The state of the client information is unknown because some databases do not allow multiple client info properties to be set atomically.
