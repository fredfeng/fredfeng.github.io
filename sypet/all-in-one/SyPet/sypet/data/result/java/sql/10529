The type of the Java object will be the default Java object type corresponding to the column\u0027s SQL type, following the mapping for built-in types specified in the JDBC specification. If the value is an SQL \u003ccode\u003eNULL\u003c/code\u003e, the driver returns a Java \u003ccode\u003enull\u003c/code\u003e. \u003cp\u003eThis method may also be used to read database-specific abstract data types.
