This method cannot be called when the cursor is on the insert row. \u003cP\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003erefreshRow\u003c/code\u003e method provides a way for an application to explicitly tell the JDBC driver to refetch a row(s) from the database.  An application may want to call \u003ccode\u003erefreshRow\u003c/code\u003e when caching or prefetching is being done by the JDBC driver to fetch the latest value of a row from the database.  The JDBC driver may actually refresh multiple rows at once if the fetch size is greater than one. \u003cP\u003e All values are refetched subject to the transaction isolation level and cursor sensitivity.
