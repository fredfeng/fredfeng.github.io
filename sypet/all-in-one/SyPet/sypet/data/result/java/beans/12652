This method is intended for use when generating Java code to reflect changes made through the property editor. \u003cp\u003e The code fragment should be context free and must be a legal Java expression as specified by the JLS. \u003cp\u003e Specifically, if the expression represents a computation then all classes and static members should be fully qualified. This rule applies to constructors, static methods and non primitive arguments. \u003cp\u003e Caution should be used when evaluating the expression as it may throw exceptions. In particular, code generators must ensure that generated code will compile in the presence of an expression that can throw checked exceptions. \u003cp\u003e Example results are: \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003ePrimitive expresssion: \u003ccode\u003e2\u003c/code\u003e \u003cli\u003eClass constructor: \u003ccode\u003enew java.awt.Color(127,127,34)\u003c/code\u003e \u003cli\u003eStatic field: \u003ccode\u003ejava.awt.Color.orange\u003c/code\u003e \u003cli\u003eStatic method: \u003ccode\u003ejavax.swing.Box.createRigidArea(new java.awt.Dimension(0, 5))\u003c/code\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e\n * @return a fragment of Java code representing an initializer for thecurrent value.
