These pools will typically improve the performance of programs that execute many short-lived asynchronous tasks. Calls to \u003ctt\u003eexecute\u003c/tt\u003e will reuse previously constructed threads if available. If no existing thread is available, a new thread will be created and added to the pool. Threads that have not been used for sixty seconds are terminated and removed from the cache. Thus, a pool that remains idle for long enough will not consume any resources. Note that pools with similar properties but different details (for example, timeout parameters) may be created using  {@link ThreadPoolExecutor} constructors.\n * @return the newly created thread pool\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"asynchron":1,"call":1,"detail":1,"second":1,"link":1,"typic":1,"use":2,"perform":1,"enough":1,"reus":2,"consum":1,"resourc":1,"pool":8,"sixti":1,"thread":10,"exist":1,"note":1,"constructor":1,"similar":1,"live":1,"mani":1,"may":1,"previous":2,"thus":1,"creat":5,"task":1,"executor":1,"paramet":1,"remov":1,"avail":3,"cach":2,"idl":1,"newli":1,"differ":1,"termin":1,"remain":1,"program":1,"exampl":1,"will":5,"ad":1,"improv":1,"properti":1,"construct":2,"execut":2,"timeout":1},"maxFreq":10,"totalTerms":78},"loc":5}
