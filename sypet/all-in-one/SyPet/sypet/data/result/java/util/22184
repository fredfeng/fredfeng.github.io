The resulting set displays the same ordering, concurrency, and performance characteristics as the backing map.  In essence, this factory method provides a  {@link Set}implementation corresponding to any  {@link Map} implementation.  Thereis no need to use this method on a  {@link Map} implementation thatalready has a corresponding  {@link Set} implementation (such as {@link HashMap} or {@link TreeMap}). \u003cp\u003eEach method invocation on the set returned by this method results in exactly one method invocation on the backing map or its \u003ctt\u003ekeySet\u003c/tt\u003e view, with one exception.  The \u003ctt\u003eaddAll\u003c/tt\u003e method is implemented as a sequence of \u003ctt\u003eput\u003c/tt\u003e invocations on the backing map. \u003cp\u003eThe specified map must be empty at the time this method is invoked, and should not be accessed directly after this method returns.  These conditions are ensured if the map is created empty, passed directly to this method, and no reference to the map is retained, as illustrated in the following code fragment: \u003cpre\u003e Set\u0026lt;Object\u0026gt; weakHashSet \u003d Collections.newSetFromMap( new WeakHashMap\u0026lt;Object, Boolean\u0026gt;()); \u003c/pre\u003e\n * @param map the backing map\n * @return the set backed by the map\n * @throws IllegalArgumentException if \u003ctt\u003emap\u003c/tt\u003e is not empty\n * @since 1.6\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"need":1,"perform":1,"must":1,"specifi":2,"time":1,"tree":1,"refer":1,"sequenc":1,"exact":1,"key":1,"follow":1,"argument":1,"except":2,"hash":3,"creat":1,"invok":1,"display":1,"provid":1,"invoc":3,"thatalreadi":1,"retain":1,"therei":1,"view":1,"collect":1,"characterist":1,"result":2,"put":1,"essenc":1,"correspond":2,"concurr":1,"one":2,"link":6,"use":1,"object":2,"add":1,"ensur":1,"order":1,"factori":1,"map":18,"fragment":1,"direct":2,"condit":1,"back":6,"access":1,"illeg":1,"empti":3,"pass":1,"pre":2,"method":9,"weak":2,"illustr":1},"maxFreq":18,"totalTerms":101},"loc":3}
