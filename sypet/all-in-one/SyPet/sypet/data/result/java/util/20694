More formally, adds the specified element \u003ctt\u003ee\u003c/tt\u003e to this set if the set contains no element \u003ctt\u003ee2\u003c/tt\u003e such that \u003ctt\u003e(e\u003d\u003dnull\u0026nbsp;?\u0026nbsp;e2\u003d\u003dnull\u0026nbsp;:\u0026nbsp;e.equals(e2))\u003c/tt\u003e. If this set already contains the element, the call leaves the set unchanged and returns \u003ctt\u003efalse\u003c/tt\u003e.  In combination with the restriction on constructors, this ensures that sets never contain duplicate elements. \u003cp\u003eThe stipulation above does not imply that sets must accept all elements; sets may refuse to add any particular element, including \u003ctt\u003enull\u003c/tt\u003e, and throw an exception, as described in the specification for  {@link Collection#add Collection.add}.
