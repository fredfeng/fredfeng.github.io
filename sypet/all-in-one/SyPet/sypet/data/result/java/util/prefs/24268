In effect, this method does a depth first traversal of the \"cached subtree\" rooted at this node, calling syncSpi() on each node in the subTree while only that node is locked. Note that syncSpi() is invoked top-down.\n * @throws BackingStoreException if this operation cannot be completeddue to a failure in the backing store, or inability to communicate with it.\n * @throws IllegalStateException if this node (or an ancestor) has beenremoved with the  {@link #removeNode()} method.\n * @see #flush()\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"call":2,"sub":1,"store":2,"completeddu":1,"root":1,"link":2,"state":1,"child":3,"tree":1,"oper":1,"sync":6,"spi":3,"subtre":1,"subsequ":1,"ancestor":1,"note":1,"top":1,"travers":1,"inabl":1,"except":2,"unlock":1,"helper":1,"failur":1,"creat":1,"invok":3,"beenremov":1,"lock":2,"remov":2,"back":2,"cach":3,"illeg":1,"depth":1,"node":8,"specif":1,"flush":1,"communic":1,"per":1,"effect":1,"method":5,"prefer":1,"first":1,"recurs":2},"maxFreq":8,"totalTerms":74},"loc":3}
