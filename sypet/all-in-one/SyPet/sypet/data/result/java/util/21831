The list must be sorted into ascending order according to the specified comparator (as by the {@link #sort(List,Comparator) sort(List, Comparator)}method), prior to making this call.  If it is not sorted, the results are undefined.  If the list contains multiple elements equal to the specified object, there is no guarantee which one will be found. \u003cp\u003eThis method runs in log(n) time for a \"random access\" list (which provides near-constant-time positional access).  If the specified list does not implement the  {@link RandomAccess} interface and is large,this method will do an iterator-based binary search that performs O(n) link traversals and O(log n) element comparisons.\n * @param list the list to be searched.\n * @param key the key to be searched for.\n * @param c the comparator by which the list is ordered.A \u003ctt\u003enull\u003c/tt\u003e value indicates that the elements\u0027 {@linkplain Comparable natural ordering} should be used.\n * @return the index of the search key, if it is contained in the list;otherwise, \u003ctt\u003e(-(\u003ci\u003einsertion point\u003c/i\u003e) - 1)\u003c/tt\u003e.  The \u003ci\u003einsertion point\u003c/i\u003e is defined as the point at which the key would be inserted into the list: the index of the first element greater than the key, or \u003ctt\u003elist.size()\u003c/tt\u003e if all elements in the list are less than the specified key.
