Extensions and private use subtags will be in canonical order as explained in  {@link #toLanguageTag}. \u003cp\u003eWhen the locale has neither script nor extensions, the result is the same as in Java 6 and prior. \u003cp\u003eIf both the language and country fields are missing, this function will return the empty string, even if the variant, script, or extensions field is present (you can\u0027t have a locale with just a variant, the variant must accompany a well-formed language or country code). \u003cp\u003eIf script or extensions are present and variant is missing, no underscore is added before the \"#\". \u003cp\u003eThis behavior is designed to support debugging and to be compatible with previous uses of \u003ccode\u003etoString\u003c/code\u003e that expected language, country, and variant fields only.
