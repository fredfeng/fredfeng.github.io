(If \u003ctt\u003efromIndex\u003c/tt\u003e and \u003ctt\u003etoIndex\u003c/tt\u003e are equal, the returned list is empty.)  The returned list is backed by this list, so non-structural changes in the returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa. The returned list supports all of the optional list operations supported by this list.\u003cp\u003e This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of the sort that commonly exist for arrays).  Any operation that expects a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view instead of a whole list.  For example, the following idiom removes a range of elements from a list: \u003cpre\u003e list.subList(from, to).clear(); \u003c/pre\u003e Similar idioms may be constructed for \u003ctt\u003eindexOf\u003c/tt\u003e and \u003ctt\u003elastIndexOf\u003c/tt\u003e, and all of the algorithms in the \u003ctt\u003eCollections\u003c/tt\u003e class can be applied to a subList.\u003cp\u003e The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if the backing list (i.e., this list) is \u003ci\u003estructurally modified\u003c/i\u003e in any way other than via the returned list.
