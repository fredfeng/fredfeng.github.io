(If {@code fromIndex} and {@code toIndex} are equal, the returned list isempty.)  The returned list is backed by this list, so non-structural changes in the returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa. The returned list supports all of the optional list operations. \u003cp\u003eThis method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of the sort that commonly exist for arrays).  Any operation that expects a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view instead of a whole list.  For example, the following idiom removes a range of elements from a list: \u003cpre\u003e list.subList(from, to).clear(); \u003c/pre\u003e Similar idioms may be constructed for  {@link #indexOf(Object)} and{@link #lastIndexOf(Object)}, and all of the algorithms in the {@link Collections} class can be applied to a subList.\u003cp\u003eThe semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if the backing list (i.e., this list) is \u003ci\u003estructurally modified\u003c/i\u003e in any way other than via the returned list.
