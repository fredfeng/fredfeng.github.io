The returned array elements are in no particular order. If the queue fits in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this queue. \u003cp\u003eIf this queue fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e., the array has more elements than this queue), the element in the array immediately following the end of the queue is set to {@code null}. \u003cp\u003eLike the  {@link #toArray()} method, this method acts as bridge betweenarray-based and collection-based APIs.  Further, this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs. \u003cp\u003eSuppose  {@code x} is a queue known to contain only strings.The following code can be used to dump the queue into a newly allocated array of  {@code String}: \u003cpre\u003e String[] y \u003d x.toArray(new String[0]);\u003c/pre\u003e Note that  {@code toArray(new Object[0])} is identical in function to{@code toArray()}.\n * @param a the array into which the elements of the queue are tobe stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same runtime type is allocated for this purpose\n * @return an array containing all of the elements in this queue\n * @throws ArrayStoreException if the runtime type of the specified arrayis not a supertype of the runtime type of every element in this queue\n * @throws NullPointerException if the specified array is null\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"queue":11,"store":2,"save":1,"particular":1,"enough":1,"type":6,"specifi":6,"function":1,"precis":1,"purpos":1,"tobe":1,"everi":1,"follow":2,"therein":1,"element":7,"control":1,"except":2,"spare":1,"runtim":6,"circumst":1,"like":1,"cost":1,"size":1,"newli":1,"contain":3,"pointer":1,"known":1,"big":1,"output":1,"room":1,"alloc":4,"array":22,"collect":1,"otherwis":2,"dump":1,"allow":1,"link":1,"use":2,"object":1,"fit":2,"order":1,"ident":1,"bridg":1,"immedi":1,"end":1,"note":1,"may":1,"supertyp":1,"suppos":1,"arrayi":1,"pre":2,"string":4,"base":2,"method":3,"certain":1,"act":1,"betweenarray":1},"maxFreq":22,"totalTerms":127},"loc":16}
