If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress (except through the iterator\u0027s own  {@code remove} operation), the results ofthe iteration are undefined.  The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the {@code Iterator.remove},  {@code Set.remove}, {@code removeAll},  {@code retainAll}, and  {@code clear}operations.  It does not support the  {@code add} or {@code addAll}operations.\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"progress":1,"result":1,"via":1,"vice":1,"correspond":1,"link":1,"add":2,"clear":1,"order":1,"oper":3,"ofth":1,"map":6,"undefin":1,"key":3,"versa":1,"element":1,"except":1,"support":2,"remov":6,"back":1,"contain":1,"modifi":1,"retain":1,"chang":1,"view":1,"ascend":1,"iter":5,"reflect":1},"maxFreq":6,"totalTerms":48},"loc":3}
