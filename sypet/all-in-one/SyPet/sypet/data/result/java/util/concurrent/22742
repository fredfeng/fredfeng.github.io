If the set fits in the specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this set. \u003cp\u003eIf this set fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e., the array has more elements than this set), the element in the array immediately following the end of the set is set to \u003ctt\u003enull\u003c/tt\u003e.  (This is useful in determining the length of this set \u003ci\u003eonly\u003c/i\u003e if the caller knows that this set does not contain any null elements.) \u003cp\u003eIf this set makes any guarantees as to what order its elements are returned by its iterator, this method must return the elements in the same order. \u003cp\u003eLike the  {@link #toArray()} method, this method acts as bridge betweenarray-based and collection-based APIs.  Further, this method allows precise control over the runtime type of the output array, and may, under certain circumstances, be used to save allocation costs. \u003cp\u003eSuppose \u003ctt\u003ex\u003c/tt\u003e is a set known to contain only strings.
