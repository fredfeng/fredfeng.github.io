It then scans the input sequence looking for matches of the pattern.  Characters that are not part of any match are appended directly to the result string; each match is replaced in the result by the replacement string.  The replacement string may contain references to captured subsequences as in the  {@link #appendReplacement appendReplacement} method.\u003cp\u003e Note that backslashes (\u003ctt\u003e\\\u003c/tt\u003e) and dollar signs (\u003ctt\u003e$\u003c/tt\u003e) in the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it were being treated as a literal replacement string. Dollar signs may be treated as references to captured subsequences as described above, and backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement string. \u003cp\u003e Given the regular expression \u003ctt\u003ea*b\u003c/tt\u003e, the input \u003ctt\u003e\"aabfooaabfooabfoob\"\u003c/tt\u003e, and the replacement string \u003ctt\u003e\"-\"\u003c/tt\u003e, an invocation of this method on a matcher for that expression would yield the string \u003ctt\u003e\"-foo-foo-foo-\"\u003c/tt\u003e. \u003cp\u003e Invoking this method changes this matcher\u0027s state.
