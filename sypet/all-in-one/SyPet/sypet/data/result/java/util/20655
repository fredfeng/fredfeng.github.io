{"id":20655,"className":"java.util.IdentityHashMap","methodName":"keySet","signature":"\u003cjava.util.IdentityHashMap: java.util.Set\u003cK\u003e keySet()\u003e","javadoc":"/** \n * Returns an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map. The set is backed by the map, so changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa.  If the map is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress, the results of the iteration are undefined.  The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map, via the \u003ctt\u003eIterator.remove\u003c/tt\u003e, \u003ctt\u003eSet.remove\u003c/tt\u003e, \u003ctt\u003eremoveAll\u003c/tt\u003e, \u003ctt\u003eretainAll\u003c/tt\u003e, and \u003ctt\u003eclear\u003c/tt\u003e methods.  It does not support the \u003ctt\u003eadd\u003c/tt\u003e or \u003ctt\u003eaddAll\u003c/tt\u003e methods. \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eWhile the object returned by this method implements the \u003ctt\u003eSet\u003c/tt\u003e interface, it does \u003ci\u003enot\u003c/i\u003e obey \u003ctt\u003eSet\u0027s\u003c/tt\u003e general contract.  Like its backing map, the set returned by this method defines element equality as reference-equality rather than object-equality.  This affects the behavior of its \u003ctt\u003econtains\u003c/tt\u003e, \u003ctt\u003eremove\u003c/tt\u003e, \u003ctt\u003econtainsAll\u003c/tt\u003e, \u003ctt\u003eequals\u003c/tt\u003e, and \u003ctt\u003ehashCode\u003c/tt\u003e methods.\u003c/b\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eThe \u003ctt\u003eequals\u003c/tt\u003e method of the returned set returns \u003ctt\u003etrue\u003c/tt\u003e only if the specified object is a set containing exactly the same object references as the returned set.  The symmetry and transitivity requirements of the \u003ctt\u003eObject.equals\u003c/tt\u003e contract may be violated if the set returned by this method is compared to a normal set.  However, the \u003ctt\u003eObject.equals\u003c/tt\u003e contract is guaranteed to hold among sets returned by this method.\u003c/b\u003e \u003cp\u003eThe \u003ctt\u003ehashCode\u003c/tt\u003e method of the returned set returns the sum of the \u003ci\u003eidentity hashcodes\u003c/i\u003e of the elements in the set, rather than the sum of their hashcodes.  This is mandated by the change in the semantics of the \u003ctt\u003eequals\u003c/tt\u003e method, in order to enforce the general contract of the \u003ctt\u003eObject.hashCode\u003c/tt\u003e method among sets returned by this method.\n * @return an identity-based set view of the keys contained in this map\n * @see Object#equals(Object)\n * @see System#identityHashCode(Object)\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"progress":1,"via":1,"normal":1,"violat":1,"transit":1,"specifi":1,"requir":1,"refer":2,"among":2,"exact":1,"undefin":1,"howev":1,"key":3,"versa":1,"element":3,"support":2,"enforc":1,"contract":4,"hash":4,"hold":1,"hashcod":2,"remov":6,"symmetri":1,"like":1,"obey":1,"system":1,"contain":5,"retain":1,"view":2,"compar":1,"result":1,"defin":1,"vice":1,"correspond":1,"behavior":1,"sum":2,"object":10,"mandat":1,"add":2,"affect":1,"clear":1,"order":1,"ident":4,"semant":1,"map":8,"rather":2,"may":1,"guarante":1,"back":2,"true":1,"equal":9,"general":2,"base":2,"modifi":1,"method":12,"chang":2,"iter":3,"reflect":1},"maxFreq":12,"totalTerms":129},"loc":7}
