All permutations occur with equal likelihood assuming that the source of randomness is fair.\u003cp\u003e This implementation traverses the list backwards, from the last element up to the second, repeatedly swapping a randomly selected element into the \"current position\".  Elements are randomly selected from the portion of the list that runs from the first element to the current position, inclusive.\u003cp\u003e This method runs in linear time.  If the specified list does not implement the  {@link RandomAccess} interface and is large, thisimplementation dumps the specified list into an array before shuffling it, and dumps the shuffled array back into the list.
