Typically, an exception will be thrown (such as  {@link IllegalMonitorStateException}) and the implementation must document that fact. \u003cp\u003eAn implementation can favor responding to an interrupt over normal method return in response to a signal. In that case the implementation must ensure that the signal is redirected to another waiting thread, if there is one.\n * @throws InterruptedException if the current thread is interrupted(and interruption of thread suspension is supported)\n */\n","tf":{"freq":{"acquir":1,"test":1,"normal":1,"wait":2,"whether":1,"must":3,"specifi":1,"becom":1,"respond":2,"thread":21,"wakeup":1,"purpos":1,"happen":2,"quot":2,"sinterrupt":1,"awaken":1,"except":4,"thrown":2,"monitor":1,"support":3,"spurious":1,"respons":1,"status":2,"invok":2,"hold":2,"disabl":1,"await":1,"determin":1,"will":1,"thecurr":1,"favor":1,"thing":1,"call":1,"linkplain":3,"waitingand":1,"link":4,"one":2,"state":1,"typic":1,"schedul":1,"signal":5,"anoth":1,"chosen":1,"ensur":1,"clear":1,"document":1,"releas":1,"associ":3,"consider":1,"current":8,"redirect":1,"four":1,"condit":5,"assum":1,"guarante":1,"entri":1,"lock":5,"illeg":1,"interrupt":15,"thethread":1,"suspens":3,"fact":1,"caus":1,"method":6,"first":1,"lie":1,"dormant":1,"atomicallyreleas":1,"occur":2},"maxFreq":21,"totalTerms":153},"loc":0}
