For example, an applet with animation might want to use the \u003ccode\u003estart\u003c/code\u003e method to resume animation, and the \u003ccode\u003estop\u003c/code\u003e method to suspend the animation. \u003cp\u003e Note: some methods, such as \u003ccode\u003egetLocationOnScreen\u003c/code\u003e, can only provide meaningful results if the applet is showing.
